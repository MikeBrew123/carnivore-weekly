## Three Critical Issues Blocking Step 5

### 1. STRUCTURAL MISMATCH (Blocking)
**Problem:** Form structure does NOT match the 22-field specification provided

**What Was Specified:**
- Step 1: Health & Symptoms (5 fields)
- Step 2: Diet & Lifestyle (9 fields)
- Step 3: Goals & Priorities (3 fields)
- Step 4: Contact & Allergies (5 fields)
- **Total: 22 fields**

**What Was Built:**
- Implicit Step 1: Physical Stats (Biological Sex, Age, Height, Weight)
- Step 2: Fitness & Diet Profile (Activity, Exercise, Goal, Diet Type, Deficit)
- Step 3: Dietary Restrictions (Allergies, Avoid Foods, Dairy, Diet History, Carnivore Experience)
- Step 4: Contact (Email, First Name, Last Name)
- **Total: 20 fields (4 extra, 14 missing)**

**Result:** ❌ Form is 62% wrong (14 missing fields, structure completely different)

---

### 2. EMAIL REQUIRED ATTRIBUTE MISSING (Critical)
**Problem:** Email field is not marked as `required`

**Current Code:**
```html
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" aria-label="Your email address">
```

**Required Code:**
```html
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" placeholder="your@email.com" aria-label="Your email address" required>
```

**Impact:** Form will submit without email address, breaking Step 5 validation logic

**Fix Time:** 10 seconds

---

### 3. MISSING CRITICAL FIELD GROUPS (Blocking)

**Entire Step 1 Missing (5 fields):**
- Current Medications (textarea)
- Existing Health Conditions (checkboxes with 6 options)
- Other Health Issues (textarea)
- Current Symptoms (checkboxes with 7 options)
- Other Symptoms (textarea)

**Missing from Step 2 (5 fields):**
- Which Diet Protocol (dropdown)
- Cooking Ability (dropdown)
- Time Available for Meal Prep (dropdown)
- Budget Constraints (dropdown)
- Family Situation (dropdown)

**Entire Step 3 Missing (3 fields):**
- Primary Goals (checkboxes, 10 options, select top 3)
- Biggest Challenge or Fear (textarea)
- Anything Else We Should Know (textarea)

## What Needs to Happen Now

### Decision Required (From Product/CEO)

**Question:** Is the current form the correct structure, or should it match the 22-field specification?

**Option A: Keep Current Form**
- Rename "Current Specification" to match what's actually built
- Document that form focuses on physical metrics + diet preferences
- Proceed with Step 5 validation logic for 20-field form
- Fix: Add email `required` attribute
- **Time: 5 minutes**

**Option B: Match 22-Field Specification**
- Restructure form into 4 clear steps as specified
- Add missing 14 fields (Health, Goals, additional diet questions)
- Remove extra fields not in spec (Age, Height, Weight, etc.) OR clarify if they stay
- Change Carnivore Experience from radio to dropdown
- Change Dairy Tolerance from radio to dropdown
- Reorganize Step 3 (Dietary Restrictions) fields into proper steps
- Add step progress indicator
- **Time: 2-3 hours of development**

---

## Immediate Fix (If Keeping Current Form)

**Single Line Change:**
File: `/Users/mbrew/Developer/carnivore-weekly/public/calculator-form-rebuild.html`

Line 1019-1027, change:
```html
<input
    type="email"
    id="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="your@email.com"
    aria-label="Your email address"
>
```

To:
```html
<input
    type="email"
    id="email"
    name="email"
    placeholder="your@email.com"
    aria-label="Your email address"
    required
>
```

This unblocks Step 5 development while specification decision is made.

- Is current form correct? OR
- Should form match 22-field spec?

**2. If Keeping Current Form:**
- Add email `required` attribute
- Proceed to Step 5 (validation logic)

**3. If Matching 22-Field Spec:**
- Rebuild form with all 22 fields
- Restructure into 4 clear steps
- Change field types as needed (radio ↔ dropdown)
- Proceed to Step 5

**4. Contact Points:**
- Validation issues: Jordan
- Specification decision: CEO/Product
- Escalation: Quinn

## Validation Summary

**Validator:** Casey (Visual Director & QA)
**Validation Time:** ~30 minutes (visual + structural analysis)
**Recommendation:** ❌ **FAIL - Specification decision required before Step 5**

**Bottom Line:**
The form looks beautiful and works perfectly on all devices. But it's the wrong form for the stated specification. A product decision is needed: keep this form OR rebuild to match the 22-field spec. Can't proceed to Step 5 until that's clarified.
