<p>PSMF stands for Protein Sparing Modified Fast. It's basically eating protein only, minimal fat, to hit aggressive fat loss goals. A lot of carnivores are asking: can I do PSMF on carnivore? Is it safe? Does it actually work?</p>



                <div class="tldr-box tldr-box--green">
                    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Here's the real answer: It works. It's not comfortable. And probably not something you should do for long.</li>
                        <li>The goal is to lose fat while theoretically preserving muscle. It's a shortcut. A fast shortcut. And like most shortcuts, it comes with trade-offs.</li>
                        <li>Most people lose 2-4 pounds per week on PSMF. That's real. That's also the kind of weight loss that gets everyone's attention at the gym.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

<p>Here's the real answer: It works. It's not comfortable. And probably not something you should do for long.</p>

<h2>What Is PSMF Actually?</h2>

<p>PSMF is eating roughly 1.0g of protein per pound of target body weight, with as little fat as possible. On carnivore, that means eating very lean meat only. Chicken breast, sirloin, fish, ground beef that's extra lean.</p>

                <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                    "Here's the real answer: It works. It's not comfortable. And probably not something you should do for long."
                </blockquote>



<p>The goal is to lose fat while theoretically preserving muscle. It's a shortcut. A fast shortcut. And like most shortcuts, it comes with trade-offs.</p>

<h2>Does It Work? Yes, But...</h2>

<p>Fat loss is straightforward: calories in vs. calories out. PSMF creates an extreme calorie deficit because you're eating protein (expensive calorically to digest) and almost no fat. You will lose fat, and you'll lose it quickly.</p>

<p>Most people lose 2-4 pounds per week on PSMF. That's real. That's also the kind of weight loss that gets everyone's attention at the gym.</p>

<h3>The Drawbacks</h3>

<p>You'll be hungry. Protein is less satiating than fat. You'll think about food constantly. Your energy will dip. You'll be cold. Literally colder than normal because your body isn't producing as much heat from fat metabolism.</p>

<p>You might lose some muscle too, despite eating protein. The deficit is just too extreme for many people to preserve 100% of muscle mass.</p>

<h2>Should You Do It?</h2>

<p>Not for months. Maybe 4-8 weeks if you need to hit a specific goal. A wedding, a photo shoot, something with a deadline. Not as a lifestyle.</p>

<p>If you're healthy, your body composition is already decent, and you just want to get leaner, PSMF works. If you're starting from overweight or you have metabolic issues, start with regular carnivore first. Get that working. Then consider PSMF as a finishing move, not the main strategy.</p>

<h2>On Carnivore, What Does PSMF Look Like?</h2>

<p>Lots of chicken breast. Lots of white fish. Very lean ground beef. Maybe eggs but be cautious on the yolks. Organ meats if you want them (nose-to-tail eating is carnivore, not PSMF specifically, but they pair well).</p>

<p>No butter. No fatty cuts. This is the opposite of what feels good on carnivore. You'll notice the difference immediately.</p>

<h2>One Thing People Get Wrong</h2>

<p>PSMF is a tool. Tools have specific uses. You don't use a hammer when you need a screwdriver. PSMF is the hammer for "I need fat loss fast." But most of the time, regular carnivore (with plenty of fat) is the right tool.</p>

<p>Use PSMF as a sprint. Not a marathon.</p>

<h2>The Honest Take</h2>

<p>PSMF works. It sucks. It's temporary. If you understand those three things and you still want to do it, you'll be fine. Just don't expect it to feel amazing. The results will be amazing. The experience will be uncomfortable. That's the trade-off.</p>
