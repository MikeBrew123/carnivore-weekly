The primary symptom is insulin resistance. The treatment options from conventional medicine often miss the root cause.</p><p>Here's what I've seen work: eliminate seed oils, eliminate processed carbs, eat meat and fat.</p><p>Seed oils are high in linoleic acid. Linoleic acid gets stored in cell membranes and interferes with hormone production. Your body literally can't make progesterone and estrogen efficiently when your cells are packed with seed oil.</p><p>Carnivore fixes this.</p><h2>The Timeline</h2><p>Month 1: Inflammation drops. Energy improves.</p><p>Month 2-3: Cycle becomes more regular. Periods less painful.</p><p>Month 4-6: Full hormone rebalancing. Cycle normalizes.</p><h2>Blood Work Changes</h2><p>Testosterone drops to normal ranges. DHEA-S improves. LH/FSH ratio normalizes. Your body starts producing the right hormones in the right amounts.</p><p>This isn't me speculating. This is documented in bloodwork from women doing carnivore with PCOS.</p><h2>The Science</h2><p>Your ovaries need cholesterol to make hormones. Carnivore gives you abundant cholesterol from animal products. Your body has the building blocks it needs. Combined with eliminated seed oils, your system can finally function.</p><p>Not a doctor. But I've watched this pattern repeat too many times to ignore it.</p><p>—Sarah</p></body></html>
