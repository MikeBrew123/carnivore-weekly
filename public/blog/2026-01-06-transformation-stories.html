<!-- Story 1: James -->
<div class="story-card">
<div class="starting-point">
<h4>Starting Point</h4>
<p>42-year-old, 280 lbs, diagnosed Type 2 diabetes two years prior. On metformin and lisinopril. A1C of 9.2. "Felt like I was dying slowly."</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The trigger:</strong> His daughter sent him a YouTube video about carnivore and insulin resistance. He was skeptical but desperate.</p>
<p><strong>What he did:</strong> Started all-beef carnivore. No carbs, no supplements, just beef and salt. Kept his medications initially but had his doctor monitor blood sugar weekly.</p>
<div class="story-timeline">
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 2</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Blood sugar readings dropping significantly (140s instead of 200s)</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 4</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Doctor reduced metformin by 50% to prevent hypoglycemia</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 8</span>
<span class="timeline-content">A1C at 6.8. Metformin discontinued. Still on lisinopril.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Month 6</span>
<span class="timeline-content">A1C at 5.9 (non-diabetic range). Weight 235 lbs (45 lbs lost). Blood pressure improved.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="results-box">
<h4>Now (18 months in)</h4>
<p>225 lbs, A1C 5.7 (completely reversed), off all diabetic medications. Still on lisinopril (chronic condition).</p>
<p class="quote">"I got my life back."</p>
</div>
<div class="insight-box">
<p><strong>What matters here:</strong> Medical oversight changed the outcome. His doctor was skeptical but willing to monitor. That monitoring prevented dangerous hypoglycemia while he was adapting. This is what responsible protocol looks like.</p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- Story 2: Sarah -->
<div class="story-card">
<div class="starting-point">
<h4>Starting Point</h4>
<p>38-year-old, autoimmune disease (rheumatoid arthritis), on immunosuppressants. Joint pain, fatigue, brain fog. "I was on 15 different supplements trying to manage symptoms."</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The trigger:</strong> Saw an interview with someone whose autoimmune markers improved on carnivore. Thought "what do I have to lose?"</p>
<p><strong>What she did:</strong> Beef, salt, water. Nothing else for 90 days. Got baseline bloodwork including CRP (inflammation marker), ESR (inflammation indicator), and antibody panels.</p>
<div class="story-timeline">
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 1-2</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Felt worse initially (standard adaptation)</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 3</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Joint pain decreased noticeably</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 6</span>
<span class="timeline-content">CRP dropped from 8.5 to 4.2. Off two supplements.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 12</span>
<span class="timeline-content">CRP at 2.1 (almost normal range). Rheumatologist was shocked.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Month 6</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Off immunosuppressant medication (under doctor supervision). Taking only anti-inflammatory as needed.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="results-box">
<h4>Now (2 years in)</h4>
<p>CRP consistently &lt;2. Off all immunosuppressants. Arthritis is "manageable on bad days." Weight stable.</p>
<p class="quote">"This isn't a cure, but it's the closest I've come."</p>
</div>
<div class="insight-box">
<p><strong>What matters here:</strong> This wasn't about weight loss. This was about inflammatory markers. The mechanism: removing plant foods eliminated lectins and other potential triggers. Her immune system calmed down when the inflammatory stimulus disappeared.</p>
</div>

<!-- Story 3: Marcus -->
<div class="story-card">
<div class="starting-point">
<h4>Starting Point</h4>
<p>32-year-old CrossFit athlete, 185 lbs, already pretty fit. Goal: build more muscle and improve performance without the bloat he felt from high-carb athlete diets.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The trigger:</strong> Curious about carnivore after seeing athletes like Anthony Chaffee. "I wanted to test if you could perform at high level on just meat."</p>
<p><strong>What he did:</strong> High-fat beef (ribeyes, ground beef 80/20), eggs, salt. Ate to appetite, trained hard (5x/week CrossFit + 2x/week strength).</p>
<div class="story-timeline">
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 1-3</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Felt flat during training (normal adaptation). Wanted to quit.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 4-6</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Energy returned. Lifts starting to improve.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Month 3</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Lean mass up 4 lbs (to 189), body fat down 3%. Strength up: deadlift +25 lbs, squat +15 lbs.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Month 6</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Lean mass up 8 lbs total (193 lbs), body fat down 6%. Performance PRs across the board.</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="results-box">
<h4>Now (2 years in)</h4>
<p>198 lbs (up from 185 start, but 13 lbs of that is muscle gain). Body composition: 9% body fat (best ever). Competing in CrossFit regionals.</p>
<p class="quote">"Strength improved, body composition improved, and I don't feel bloated ever."</p>
</div>
<div class="insight-box">
<p><strong>What matters here:</strong> Performance doesn't require carbs. This challenges the "you need carbs to be an athlete" narrative. The mechanism: improved metabolic efficiency, better recovery (no glucose spikes/crashes), stable energy throughout training.</p>
</div>
</div>
<!-- Story 4: Lisa -->
<div class="story-card">
<div class="starting-point">
<h4>Starting Point</h4>
<p>34-year-old, depression and anxiety for 15 years, on sertraline and propranolol, 200 lbs, constant brain fog, mood swings. "My psychiatrist had tried 9 different medications."</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The trigger:</strong> Read about gut-brain connection and how diet affects mental health. "I figured I had nothing to lose."</p>
<p><strong>What she did:</strong> Carnivore (beef, eggs, salt). Kept her medications - didn't want to risk anything. But tracked mood on a daily scale (1-10).</p>
<div class="story-timeline">
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 2</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Noticed mood more stable (less random crashes)</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 4</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Anxiety decreased noticeably. Weight down 6 lbs.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Week 8</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Psychiatrist noticed mood improvement, discussed potential medication adjustment</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Month 4</span>
<span class="timeline-content">On lower sertraline dose. Propranolol no longer needed. Mood consistently 8-9/10.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Month 6</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Off sertraline completely (under supervision). Mood stable. "Better than any medication"</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="results-box">
<h4>Now (18 months in)</h4>
<p>Off all psychiatric medication, stable mood, lost 45 lbs (to 155), menstrual cycle regulated (was irregular on medication), energy high.</p>
<p class="quote">"I finally feel like myself."</p>
</div>
<div class="insight-box">
<p><strong>What matters here:</strong> The mechanism likely involves: stable blood sugar (no mood crashes), reduced inflammation (affects neurotransmitters), improved nutrient absorption (amino acids needed for serotonin/dopamine), removal of plant antinutrients that can affect mood. This wasn't the diet "fixing" mental health - it was removing barriers to mental health.</p>

<p>67-year-old, retired, family history of dementia and heart disease. Weight 220 lbs. No major diagnosis, but "feeling old" and worried about cognitive decline.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>The trigger:</strong> Read an article about diet and dementia prevention. Figured it was worth a try to "hedge his bets" against aging.</p>
<p><strong>What he did:</strong> Carnivore, focused on high-nutrient foods (organs, eggs, fatty meat). Got baseline cognitive testing and bloodwork including apoB, inflammation markers, and brain imaging.</p>
<div class="story-timeline">
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Month 3</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Bloodwork improved across markers. Brain fog cleared. "Thinking faster again."</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Month 6</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Weight down to 195. Energy higher than it's been in 20 years.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Year 1</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Cognitive testing actually improved from baseline (unusual at his age). LDL down, HDL up, inflammation markers down.</span>
</div>
<div class="timeline-item">
<span class="timeline-marker">Year 2</span>
<span class="timeline-content">Brain imaging shows no concerning changes (family history made this a worry).</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="results-box">
<h4>Now (3 years in)</h4>
<p>Weight stable at 190. Cognitive function high. Outlier in his family for health markers.</p>
<p class="quote">"My son is 45 and his bloodwork is worse than mine."</p>
</div>
<div class="insight-box">
<p><strong>What matters here:</strong> This is preventative health. He's not "fixing" a disease; he's optimizing longevity. Better metabolic health, lower inflammation, and improved cognitive markers are the outcome.</p>

<h3>These Stories Share Key Patterns</h3>
<div class="thread-grid">
<div class="thread-item">
<strong>Baseline Measurement</strong>
<span>They measured before, not just after. Tangible results you can point to.</span>
</div>
<div class="thread-item">
<strong>Doctor Involvement (Where Needed)</strong>
<span>The ones with serious health conditions involved medical oversight. This matters.</span>
</div>
<div class="thread-item">
<strong>Time Commitment</strong>
<span>None of these saw dramatic results in week one. All saw meaningful changes by week 12.</span>
</div>
<div class="thread-item">
<strong>Individual Variation</strong>
<span>What worked (the same diet) produced different outcomes based on individual starting points.</span>
</div>
<div class="thread-item">
<strong>Simplicity</strong>
<span>None of them optimized macros or calories. They ate meat until satisfied and tracked how they felt.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="balance-box">
<h3>What These Stories Don't Show</h3>
<p>For balance: These are positive outcomes. There are people who tried carnivore and didn't see the same results. The diet doesn't work for everyone. It works for most of the people who do it right, but not all. That's true for every diet.</p>
<p>What matters is: Before you decide if it works for you, decide if you're willing to try it properly: 90 days minimum, adequate intake, medical oversight if needed, baseline measurements so you can actually see what changed.</p>
