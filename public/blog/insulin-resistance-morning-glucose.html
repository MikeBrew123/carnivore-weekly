<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Optimal fasting glucose is 70-85 mg/dL</strong> — "normal" ranges (under 100) miss early insulin resistance by 15+ points</li>
<li><strong>Your liver controls morning glucose</strong> — elevated readings happen because insulin-resistant livers ignore the "stop producing glucose" signal</li>
<li><strong>Calculate your HOMA-IR score</strong> — (glucose × insulin) / 405 reveals true insulin sensitivity that fasting glucose alone can't show</li>
<li><strong>This is reversible</strong> — dietary changes can drop HOMA-IR from 2.8 to 1.3 in 6 months</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>You wake up, prick your finger, and see 105 mg/dL on your glucometer. Is that good? Bad? Should you worry?</p>
<p>Here's the thing: your fasting glucose isn't just a random number. It's a window into how your body handles energy while you sleep—and it can reveal insulin resistance years before you'd ever be diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.</p>
<h2>What "Normal" Actually Means (And Why It's Misleading)</h2>
<p>The official guidelines say fasting glucose under 100 mg/dL is "normal." But research suggests insulin resistance often starts developing when fasting glucose creeps above 85 mg/dL. That's a 15-point gap where your body might be struggling, but conventional medicine isn't flagging it yet.</p>
<div class="glucose-grid">
<div class="glucose-card optimal">
<div class="glucose-range">70-85</div>
<div class="glucose-label">Optimal</div>
<div class="glucose-desc">Excellent insulin sensitivity. Your metabolism is functioning well.</div>

<div class="glucose-range">126+</div>
<div class="glucose-label">Diabetic Range</div>
<div class="glucose-desc">Type 2 diabetes threshold. Requires medical management.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>I've seen this in my own health journey. When my fasting glucose sat around 95 mg/dL, my doctor said everything looked fine. But I felt tired, struggled with afternoon energy crashes, and couldn't lose weight despite eating well. Once I dug into my insulin levels, the picture became clear: my fasting insulin was 12 µIU/mL. That combination gave me a HOMA-IR score of 2.8—well into insulin resistance territory.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "Your fasting glucose shows you the tip of the iceberg. Fasting insulin reveals what's happening beneath the surface."
            </blockquote>
<h2>Why Morning Glucose Rises (Even When You Don't Eat)</h2>
<p>You might think, "I didn't eat anything overnight, so why isn't my glucose lower?" The answer is your liver.</p>
<div class="mechanism-box">

<div class="mechanism-content">
<p>While you sleep, your liver releases stored glucose to keep your brain and body running. This is totally normal—it's called <strong>hepatic glucose output</strong>.</p>
<p>But when you're insulin resistant, your liver doesn't respond properly to insulin's signal to "stop making glucose." So it keeps pumping out more than you need, and your morning number climbs higher than it should.</p>
<p>This is why someone with insulin resistance can wake up with a fasting glucose of 110 mg/dL even after eating a perfect carnivore dinner the night before. <strong>It's not about what you ate—it's about how your metabolism is functioning at a cellular level.</strong></p>

<figcaption>Blood glucose monitoring is key to understanding your metabolic health</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>The HOMA-IR Test: Your Real Insulin Sensitivity Score</h2>
<p>Fasting glucose alone doesn't tell the whole story. You need to pair it with fasting insulin to calculate your HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance).</p>
<div class="homa-section">

<div class="homa-formula">
<div class="formula-text">HOMA-IR = (Fasting Glucose × Fasting Insulin) ÷ 405</div>
<div class="formula-note">Glucose in mg/dL, Insulin in µIU/mL</div>
</div>
<div class="homa-scores">
<div class="homa-score excellent">
<div class="homa-value">&lt; 1.0</div>
<div class="homa-label">Excellent Sensitivity</div>
</div>
<div class="homa-score healthy">
<div class="homa-value">1.0 – 1.9</div>
<div class="homa-label">Healthy Range</div>
</div>
<div class="homa-score early">
<div class="homa-value">2.0 – 2.9</div>
<div class="homa-label">Early Resistance</div>
</div>
<div class="homa-score significant">
<div class="homa-value">3.0+</div>
<div class="homa-label">Significant Resistance</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>When I calculated mine (fasting glucose 95, fasting insulin 12), I got 2.8. That explained everything—the fatigue, the weight plateau, the brain fog. My body was producing too much insulin just to keep my glucose in that "normal" range.</p>
<div class="warning-box">
<h4>⚠️ Most Doctors Don't Order This Test</h4>
<p>Fasting insulin isn't part of standard bloodwork. You'll need to specifically request it. Don't accept "your glucose is fine" without knowing both numbers. The combination reveals metabolic problems 5-10 years before glucose alone would flag them.</p>
</div>
<h2>What to Do If Your Numbers Show Insulin Resistance</h2>
<p>If your fasting glucose sits above 90 mg/dL or your HOMA-IR is above 2.0, here's what actually works:</p>
<div class="action-grid">
<div class="action-card">
<span class="action-number">1</span>
<div class="action-content">
<h4>Prioritize Protein, Eliminate Processed Carbs</h4>
<p>Non-negotiable. Insulin resistance improves dramatically when you remove foods that spike insulin repeatedly. Going full carnivore dropped my fasting glucose from 95 to 82 mg/dL in 8 weeks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="action-card">
<span class="action-number">2</span>
<div class="action-content">
<h4>Track Fasting Insulin, Not Just Glucose</h4>
<p>Ask your doctor to order a fasting insulin test alongside your glucose. It's a standard blood test—most just don't suggest it automatically. You need both numbers for the full picture.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="action-card">
<span class="action-number">3</span>
<div class="action-content">
<h4>Retest in 8-12 Weeks</h4>
<p>Insulin sensitivity doesn't improve overnight. Give your body time to adapt, then recheck your HOMA-IR score. You'll see fasting insulin drop first, then glucose follows.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "Insulin resistance isn't a life sentence. It's feedback. Your body is telling you something needs to change, and it will respond when you give it the right inputs."
            </blockquote>
<h2>Why This Matters for Long-Term Health</h2>
<p>Insulin resistance doesn't just affect your energy or weight. It's the root cause of metabolic syndrome and drives progression toward serious disease.</p>
<div class="conditions-grid">

<p class="condition-desc">Insulin resistance damages blood vessels and promotes inflammation, increasing heart attack and stroke risk.</p>

<div class="success-content">
<p>Catching insulin resistance early—before your glucose hits prediabetic levels—gives you a massive advantage. Your body can reverse course. I've watched my own HOMA-IR drop from 2.8 to 1.3 over 6 months by changing how I eat and prioritizing metabolic health.</p>

<h3>🎯 Key Takeaways</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Optimal fasting glucose is 70-85 mg/dL</strong> — anything above 85 may indicate early insulin resistance, even if it's technically "normal"</li>
<li><strong>Always test fasting insulin alongside glucose</strong> — HOMA-IR calculation reveals problems 5-10 years earlier than glucose alone</li>
<li><strong>Morning glucose reflects liver function, not yesterday's dinner</strong> — elevated readings mean your liver is ignoring insulin's "stop" signal</li>
<li><strong>Insulin resistance is fully reversible</strong> — prioritize protein, eliminate processed carbs, and retest in 8-12 weeks to track improvement</li>
