                <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fasting glucose above 100 mg/dL suggests insulin resistance is developing, even if you're not diabetic yet</li>
                    <li>Your morning number reflects how well your body managed glucose overnight—not just what you ate yesterday</li>
                    <li>Pair fasting glucose with fasting insulin for the full picture (HOMA-IR score reveals true insulin sensitivity)</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>You wake up, prick your finger, and see 105 mg/dL on your glucometer. Is that good? Bad? Should you worry?</p>

            <p>Here's the thing: your fasting glucose isn't just a random number. It's a window into how your body handles energy while you sleep—and it can reveal insulin resistance years before you'd ever be diagnosed with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes.</p>

            <h2>What "Normal" Actually Means (And Why It's Misleading)</h2>

            <p>The official guidelines say fasting glucose under 100 mg/dL is "normal." But research suggests insulin resistance often starts developing when fasting glucose creeps above 85 mg/dL. That's a 15-point gap where your body might be struggling, but conventional medicine isn't flagging it yet.</p>

            <p>I've seen this in my own health journey. When my fasting glucose sat around 95 mg/dL, my doctor said everything looked fine. But I felt tired, struggled with afternoon energy crashes, and couldn't lose weight despite eating well. Once I dug into my insulin levels, the picture became clear: my fasting insulin was 12 µIU/mL. That combination gave me a HOMA-IR score of 2.8—well into insulin resistance territory.</p>

            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "Your fasting glucose shows you the tip of the iceberg. Fasting insulin reveals what's happening beneath the surface."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Why Morning Glucose Rises (Even When You Don't Eat)</h2>

            <p>You might think, "I didn't eat anything overnight, so why isn't my glucose lower?" The answer is your liver. While you sleep, your liver releases stored glucose to keep your brain and body running. This is totally normal—it's called hepatic glucose output.</p>

            <p>But when you're insulin resistant, your liver doesn't respond properly to insulin's signal to "stop making glucose." So it keeps pumping out more than you need, and your morning number climbs higher than it should.</p>

            <p>This is why someone with insulin resistance can wake up with a fasting glucose of 110 mg/dL even after eating a perfect carnivore dinner the night before. It's not about what you ate—it's about how your metabolism is functioning at a cellular level.</p>

            <h2>The HOMA-IR Test: Your Real Insulin Sensitivity Score</h2>

            <p>Fasting glucose alone doesn't tell the whole story. You need to pair it with fasting insulin to calculate your HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance). Here's the formula:</p>

            <p><strong>HOMA-IR = (Fasting Glucose × Fasting Insulin) / 405</strong></p>

            <p>What the scores mean:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Under 1.0:</strong> Excellent insulin sensitivity</li>
                <li><strong>1.0–1.9:</strong> Normal, healthy range</li>
                <li><strong>2.0–2.9:</strong> Early insulin resistance developing</li>
                <li><strong>3.0+:</strong> Significant insulin resistance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>When I calculated mine (fasting glucose 95, fasting insulin 12), I got 2.8. That explained everything—the fatigue, the weight plateau, the brain fog. My body was producing too much insulin just to keep my glucose in that "normal" range.</p>

            <h2>What to Do If Your Numbers Show Insulin Resistance</h2>

            <p>If your fasting glucose sits above 90 mg/dL or your HOMA-IR is above 2.0, here's what actually works (backed by research and my own experience):</p>

            <h3>1. Prioritize protein and eliminate processed carbs</h3>
            <p>This one's non-negotiable. Insulin resistance improves dramatically when you remove the foods that spike insulin repeatedly throughout the day. For me, going full carnivore dropped my fasting glucose from 95 to 82 mg/dL in 8 weeks.</p>

            <h3>2. Track fasting insulin, not just glucose</h3>
            <p>Ask your doctor to order a fasting insulin test alongside your glucose. Most won't suggest it automatically, but it's a standard blood test. You need both numbers to see the full picture.</p>

            <h3>3. Retest in 8–12 weeks</h3>
            <p>Insulin sensitivity doesn't improve overnight. Give your body time to adapt, then recheck your HOMA-IR score. Progress shows up in the data—you'll see fasting insulin drop first, then glucose follows.</p>

            <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                "Insulin resistance isn't a life sentence. It's feedback. Your body is telling you something needs to change, and it will respond when you give it the right inputs."
            </blockquote>

            <h2>Why This Matters for Long-Term Health</h2>

            <p>Insulin resistance doesn't just affect your energy or weight. It's the root cause of metabolic syndrome, which includes high blood pressure, elevated triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and increased visceral fat. Left unchecked, it progresses to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even Alzheimer's (which researchers now call "type 3 diabetes" because of its link to insulin dysregulation).</p>

            <p>But here's the good news: catching insulin resistance early—before your glucose hits prediabetic levels—gives you a massive advantage. Your body can reverse course. I've watched my HOMA-IR drop from 2.8 to 1.3 over 6 months by changing how I eat and prioritizing metabolic health.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Fasting glucose above 85 mg/dL may indicate early insulin resistance, even if it's still under 100 mg/dL</li>
                    <li>Pair fasting glucose with fasting insulin to calculate your HOMA-IR score for accurate assessment</li>
                    <li>Insulin resistance is reversible with dietary changes—prioritize protein, eliminate processed carbs, and retest in 8–12 weeks</li>
                    <li>Early intervention prevents progression to prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome</li>
