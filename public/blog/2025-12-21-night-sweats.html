<h1>Night Sweats on Carnivore: Why They Happen and How to Fix Them</h1>

<p>Night sweats show up for a lot of people when they start carnivore. You're doing great during the day, sleeping fine, then you wake up drenched. It's uncomfortable. It's also fixable. Let me walk you through why it happens and what actually helps.</p>

<h2>Why Night Sweats Happen on Carnivore</h2>

<p>There are a few reasons this shows up, and they're not all the same for everyone.</p>

<h3>Metabolism Ramping Up</h3>

<p>When you switch to carnivore, your metabolism often increases. Your body is working harder, burning more calories, generating more heat. Night sweats are sometimes just that: your body producing more heat than it's used to. It usually settles down after a few weeks as your system adapts.</p>

<h3>Electrolyte Imbalance</h3>

<p>More likely culprit: you need more electrolytes. Sweat is how your body releases excess electrolytes it can't use. If you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, or magnesium, your body uses sweat to balance. This usually happens at night when you're lying down and your body is redistributing fluid.</p>

<p>This is fixable in days. More salt. That's often the whole solution.</p>

<h3>Hormonal Adjustment</h3>

<p>Carnivore can affect hormones, especially when you're losing weight. Your body is releasing stored estrogen that was in fat tissue. This can trigger hot flashes and night sweats, especially for women. It's temporary. It means your body is working, not that something's wrong.</p>

<h3>Temperature Sensitivity</h3>

<p>Some people just run hotter on carnivore. Their metabolic rate is higher. The thermostat in your brain shifts. It's not dangerous; it's just different. A cooler bedroom helps. A lighter blanket helps. This usually normalizes too.</p>

<h2>What Actually Works</h2>

<p>Start with electrolytes. Seriously. Get 1-2 teaspoons of salt per day. Add it to your food, dissolve it in water, doesn't matter. Most people see night sweats improve significantly within 3 days.</p>

<p>If salt helps but doesn't eliminate the sweats, look at potassium and magnesium. A 300-400mg magnesium glycinate before bed helps many people. Potassium is trickier (high potassium can be risky), but adding bone broth (high in minerals) often helps.</p>

<h3>Sleep Environment</h3>

<p>Drop the room temperature to 65-67F if you can. Get breathable sheets (cotton or linen, not synthetic). Wear less. A heavier blanket doesn't help; a lighter one does.</p>

<h3>Timing</h3>

<p>If night sweats are happening specifically in the first 2-3 hours of sleep, it's usually metabolic heat from digestion. Eating slightly earlier in the evening might help. If they're happening 4+ hours in, it's more likely electrolytes or hormonal.</p>

<h2>When to Actually Worry</h2>

<p>Occasional night sweats are normal on carnivore. Drenching, every-night sweats for weeks straight might warrant a doctor visit to rule out infection or thyroid issues. But most of the time, this is normal adaptation and you fix it with salt and a cooler room.</p>

<h2>What Most People Miss</h2>

<p>They add layers and close windows instead of making the room cooler. They assume they need electrolyte supplements instead of just more salt. They don't give it time—night sweats usually improve by week 2 or 3 of addressing the underlying cause.</p>

<h2>The Honest Take</h2>

<p>Night sweats are uncomfortable but they're a sign your body is adapting to a new fuel source and working harder. Address electrolytes and temperature, give it 2-3 weeks, and most people see significant improvement. If you're still soaked every night after that, that's worth checking with a doctor.</p>
