<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Week one is simple:</strong> Beef, salt, water. That's it. No complexity, no variables.</li>
<li><strong>The danger zone is days 3-5:</strong> Adaptation kicks in. Electrolytes (especially salt) prevent most "keto flu" symptoms.</li>
<li><strong>30 days minimum:</strong> Give it 30 days before deciding if it works. Most see real changes by day 90.</li>
<li><strong>Track what matters:</strong> Energy, clothes fit, digestion—not just scale weight.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If you're thinking "I want to try carnivore," you're not alone. Thirty percent of Reddit's carnivore traffic is people asking: "What should I eat?" and "Will this actually work for me?"</p>
<p>Here's what I've learned watching thousands of people start: most fail in week two, not because carnivore doesn't work, but because they didn't know what to expect. Let's fix that.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
    "Most people fail in week two, not because carnivore doesn't work, but because they didn't know what to expect."
</blockquote>
<h2>Week 0: Before You Start</h2>
<div class="phase-card" data-phase="PREP">
<h3>Answer This First: Why Are You Doing This?</h3>
<p>Not the Instagram answer. The real one. Are you fixing blood sugar crashes? Trying to lose weight? Dealing with digestive issues? Clearing brain fog?</p>
<p>The answer matters because it changes what success looks like:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fat loss:</strong> Track weight and how clothes fit</li>
<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Notice afternoon crashes disappearing</li>
<li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Watch joint pain improve</li>
<li><strong>Digestion:</strong> Monitor bloating and regularity</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Also: Talk to your doctor.</strong> If you're on medication—especially for blood sugar or blood pressure—you need medical oversight. Carnivore changes how your body processes medication.</p>
</div>
<h2>Week 1: The Simple Start</h2>
<p>Your job this week is to prove you can execute the diet. That's it. Not to be perfect. Not to hit perfect macros. Just to eat meat.</p>
<div class="meal-plan">
<h3>Week One Meal Plan</h3>
<div class="meal-item">
<span class="meal-time">Breakfast</span>
<span class="meal-desc">6-8 oz ground beef with salt and water</span>
</div>
<div class="meal-item">
<span class="meal-time">Lunch</span>
<span class="meal-desc">8-10 oz steak with salt and water</span>
</div>
<div class="meal-item">
<span class="meal-time">Dinner</span>
<span class="meal-desc">10-12 oz beef roast or ground beef with salt and water</span>
</div>
<div class="meal-item">
<span class="meal-time">Snacks</span>
<span class="meal-desc">If hungry: more beef, hard-boiled eggs, or canned sardines</span>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Why beef and salt?</strong> Beef is the most nutrient-dense food available. Salt prevents electrolyte crashes that cause headaches and fatigue. Water keeps everything moving. No complexity. No variables.</p>
<p><strong>How much to eat:</strong> Until you're satisfied, not stuffed. Your hunger signals will be weird for a few days. That's normal. Listen to satiety, not quantity.</p>
<!-- Inline Image -->

<figcaption>Keep it simple. Beef, eggs, bacon—nothing complicated in week one.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="danger-zone">
<h4>⚠️ The Danger Zone: Days 3-5</h4>
<p>This is when adaptation kicks in. You might feel foggy, tired, or get a headache. This is adaptation, not failure.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Days 1-2:</strong> Probably fine. Some people feel great immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Days 3-5:</strong> The danger zone. Foggy, tired, headache possible.</li>
<li><strong>Days 6-7:</strong> Energy usually returns. Sleep might be weird.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you get a headache:</strong> Add salt (1/4 teaspoon with water) and eat more. Most "keto flu" is dehydration + electrolyte depletion, not the diet failing.</p>
</div>
<h2>Weeks 2-4: The Adaptation Phase</h2>
<div class="phase-card" data-phase="ADAPT">
<h3>Your Body Is Learning</h3>
<p>This is where your digestive system learns that you're only eating meat. Your gut bacteria shift. Your stomach acid production normalizes. Your liver adjusts to processing fat at scale.</p>
<p>This takes time. Not magic time. Physiological time.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>What changes now:</strong> You can start experimenting. Try different beef sources. Add eggs. Try pork, lamb, or fish. See what feels good. Most people find their preference—all beef, beef + eggs, or beef + fish. All valid.</p>
<p><strong>Expect:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Energy fluctuations—some days amazing, some tired</li>
<li>Appetite changes—your body is figuring out fuel needs</li>
<li>Weird sleep for 3-4 weeks (4 hours or 10 hours—both normal)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Electrolyte Reality</h2>
<div class="electrolyte-box">
<h3>This Is Where People Fail</h3>
<p>When you stop eating carbs, your body stops storing sodium (carbs bind water and sodium). You'll pee out water and electrolytes for 2-3 weeks. This is why you feel tired or get headaches.</p>
<p><strong>The fix:</strong> Salt your food. A lot. More than you think. Aim for <strong>5-10 grams of sodium per day</strong> (1-2 teaspoons of salt) for the first 3-4 weeks.</p>
<p>Yes, that sounds like a lot. You're not eating carbs, so you're not spiking insulin or retaining excess water. You need the sodium.</p>
<p><strong>Signs you're low on electrolytes:</strong></p>
<div class="symptom-grid">
<div class="symptom-item">Headaches</div>
<div class="symptom-item">Fatigue</div>
<div class="symptom-item">Muscle cramps</div>
<div class="symptom-item">Dizziness</div>
</div>
<p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Quick fix:</strong> Salt water (1/4 teaspoon in 8oz water) + food. Usually improves within 30 minutes.</p>
</div>
<h2>Tracking Progress (The Right Way)</h2>
<p>Don't just weigh yourself. Weight fluctuates 3-5 lbs daily based on water, hormones, digestion, and sodium. One number tells you almost nothing.</p>
<div class="tracking-grid">
<div class="tracking-item">
<h4>Clothes Fit</h4>
<p>More accurate than scale. Track waist, chest, arms.</p>
</div>
<div class="tracking-item">
<h4>Energy Levels</h4>
<p>Rate 1-10 throughout the day. Notice patterns.</p>
</div>
<div class="tracking-item">
<h4>Hunger Patterns</h4>
<p>Fasting easier? Less snacking? Natural satiety?</p>
</div>
<div class="tracking-item">
<h4>Digestion</h4>
<p>How are you feeling? Bloating? Regularity?</p>
</div>
<div class="tracking-item">
<h4>Sleep Quality</h4>
<p>Not duration—quality. Waking rested?</p>
</div>
<div class="tracking-item">
<h4>Mental Clarity</h4>
<p>Is brain fog gone? Focus improved?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><strong>Take photos</strong> on day 1, day 30, and day 90. You'll see changes the scale won't show.</p>
<h2>Common Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: Will my cholesterol get messed up?</strong>
<p>It might change. Some people's LDL goes up, some goes down. Total cholesterol often goes down. HDL almost always goes up. The important metrics are inflammation markers (triglycerides, apoB, hs-CRP), not total cholesterol. Get blood work at 30 and 90 days.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: How much do I actually need to eat?</strong>
<p>Until satisfied. That's it. Hunger regulation usually improves after week 2. Most people eat less naturally without trying.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: Is it okay to do this with exercise?</strong>
<p>Yes, but expect to feel flat for 2-3 weeks while adapting. Your glycogen stores are depleted. After that, many people feel stronger. Some do lighter training during adaptation.</p>
</div>
<div class="faq-item">
<strong>Q: What if I get digestive issues?</strong>
<p>Change your approach. Eat smaller meals more frequently. Try ground meat instead of whole cuts. Try different beef sources. Your digestion will adapt, but it takes time.</p>
</div>
<h2>The 90-Day Checkpoint</h2>
<p>By day 90, you'll know if this is working. You'll have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adapted metabolically (no more adaptation flu)</li>
<li>Established your preferred food selections</li>
<li>Seen measurable changes (weight, energy, how you look/feel)</li>
<li>Built the habit (it's automatic now)</li>
<li>Know how your body responds</li>
</ul>
<p>If you feel dramatically better at day 90, you've found something that works. If not, you have good data about why—and that's also valuable.</p>
<div class="action-box">
<h3>What to Do Right Now</h3>
<ol>
<li>Buy beef (ground or steak, fatty cuts are better)</li>
<li>Buy salt</li>
<li>Plan meals for the next 3 days</li>
<li>Tell your doctor</li>
<li>Take a baseline photo and write down how you feel</li>
<li>Commit to 30 days minimum—not forever, just 30 days</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="key-takeaways">
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start simple:</strong> Beef, salt, water. Don't overcomplicate week one.</li>
<li><strong>Electrolytes matter:</strong> Aim for 5-10g sodium daily during adaptation (weeks 1-4).</li>
<li><strong>The danger zone is days 3-5:</strong> If you feel bad, add salt and eat more. Don't quit.</li>
<li><strong>Track what actually matters:</strong> Energy, clothes fit, digestion—not just scale weight.</li>
<li><strong>Commit to 30 days minimum:</strong> Real adaptation takes 2-4 weeks. Best results at day 90.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>That's it. You're ready.</p>
