                <div class="post-content">
                You want to start carnivore. You're ready. But you're overwhelmed by conflicting advice.

Eat only beef. Add <a href="/wiki/#organ-meats" class="wiki-link">organs</a>. Include <a href="/wiki/#&lt;a href=" class="wiki-link">dairy</a>" class="wiki-link" data-wiki-page="/wiki/#dairy">dairy</a>. Avoid dairy. Eat once a day. Eat three times. Use <a href="/wiki/#&lt;a href=" class="wiki-link">salt</a>" class="wiki-link" data-wiki-page="/wiki/#salt">salt</a>. Don't use salt.

Stop.

Here's the beginner's blueprint. No fluff. Just the system that works.

## Week 1: Adaptation (The Hardest Week)

**Goal:** Survive adaptation without quitting.

**What to eat:**
- Beef (ground beef, ribeye, chuck roast)
- Salt (lots of it)
- Water

That's it. No dairy, no eggs, no pork, no chicken. Just beef, salt, water.

**Why only beef?**

You're eliminating variables. If you add dairy and feel terrible, you won't know if it's adaptation or dairy intolerance. Keep it simple.

**How much to eat:**

As much as you want. Seriously. Don't restrict calories. Eat until full.

Most beginners eat 2-3 lbs of meat per day. If you're hungry, eat more.

**Sample Day 1:**
- Meal 1 (12 PM): 1 lb ground beef (80/20), cooked with salt
- Meal 2 (6 PM): 16 oz ribeye, salt
- Snack if needed: More ground beef

**Electrolytes:**

This is critical. Low-carb diets deplete sodium fast. If you don't replace it, you'll feel like death.

**Targets:**
- Sodium: 5-7g per day (2-3 tsp salt)
- Magnesium: 400mg (supplement if needed)
- Potassium: 3-4g (from meat)

**How to get sodium:**
- Salt your meat heavily
- Drink salted water (1 tsp salt in 16 oz water, sip throughout the day)

**What to expect:**

**Days 1-3:**
- Hunger. You're breaking carb addiction. Eat more fat to feel full.
- Cravings for carbs, sugar, bread. Ignore them. They'll pass.

**Days 4-7:**
- Fatigue, headaches, muscle cramps (electrolyte depletion)
- Digestive changes (constipation or diarrhea)
- Irritability (carb withdrawal is real)

This is normal. It passes by week 2.

**How to survive week 1:**
- Drink salted water every 2-3 hours
- Sleep 8+ hours (your body is working hard to adapt)
- Don't train hard (light walking only)
- Eat when hungry (don't force fasting yet)

---

## Week 2-4: Fat Adaptation

**Goal:** Become fat-adapted. Your body learns to burn fat for fuel.

**What to eat:**

Same as week 1: beef, salt, water.

If you're feeling good, you can experiment with:
- Eggs (if no sensitivity)
- Pork (bacon, pork chops)
- Lamb

Still avoid dairy for now. It's a common trigger for digestive issues.

**How much to eat:**

Eat to satiety. Don't count calories. Your hunger will regulate naturally.

By week 3, you'll notice: **You're not as hungry.** This is fat adaptation. Your body is efficiently burning fat, so you don't need constant fuel.

**Sample Day 14:**
- Meal 1 (12 PM): 8 oz ribeye, 4 eggs, cooked in butter
- Meal 2 (6 PM): 1 lb ground beef, salt

Notice: You're eating twice a day now, not because you're forcing it, but because you're just not hungry in the morning.

**What to expect:**

**Week 2:**
- Energy starts returning
- Cravings diminish
- Hunger becomes less intense
- Sleep improves

**Week 3:**
- Mental clarity kicks in (this is real, not placebo)
- Digestion stabilizes
- Weight loss accelerates (if you're overweight)
- You might skip breakfast naturally

**Week 4:**
- Fat-adapted. You can go 6-8 hours without eating and feel fine.
- Strength returns to baseline (if you're lifting)
- Skin starts clearing (if you had acne)

**Electrolytes:**

Still critical. Don't stop salting your food.

**Training:**

By week 3-4, you can resume normal training. Start light and build back up.

---

## Month 2-3: Optimization

**Goal:** Find your personal carnivore template.

You're fat-adapted now. It's time to optimize.

**What to eat:**

Expand beyond beef:
- Fatty fish (salmon, mackerel, sardines)
- Organ meats (liver, heart, kidney)
- Dairy (if tolerated): butter, heavy cream, hard cheeses

**How to test dairy:**

Add one dairy item at a time. Wait 3-5 days. Monitor symptoms.

If you get bloating, gas, skin issues, or digestive upset, you're intolerant. Remove it.

**How much to eat:**

You've probably settled into 1-2 meals per day naturally. Eat when hungry.

Most people eat 1.5-2 lbs of meat per day at this point.

**Sample Day 60:**
- Meal 1 (12 PM): 12 oz salmon, 4 eggs, butter
- Meal 2 (6 PM): 16 oz ribeye, small side of liver (2 oz)

**Organ meats:**

You should start adding organs by month 2. They're nutritional powerhouses.

**Easiest way to start:**
- Liver: 2-4 oz per week (mix into ground beef if you hate the taste)
- Heart: Cook like steak, tastes mild
- Kidney: Strongest flavor, start small

You don't need organs daily. Once or twice a week is enough.

**What to expect:**

**Month 2:**
- Body composition changes accelerate (leaner, more muscle definition)
- Inflammation drops (joint pain, eczema, autoimmune symptoms improve)
- Mood stabilizes (less anxiety, better focus)

**Month 3:**
- You forget what it felt like to eat carbs
- Energy is consistent all day (no crashes)
- You've found your rhythm (meal timing, food preferences)

---

## Month 4-6: Long-Term Adaptation

**Goal:** Lock in carnivore as a sustainable lifestyle.

**What to eat:**

Whatever makes you feel best. By now, you know what works.

Most long-term carnivores settle into:
- 80% red meat (beef, lamb, bison)
- 10% fatty fish
- 10% organs, eggs, dairy (if tolerated)

**How much to eat:**

Listen to your body. Some days you'll be hungrier (after hard training). Some days you'll barely eat.

This is normal. Your appetite self-regulates.

**Fasting:**

By month 4-6, you can experiment with fasting if you want:
- OMAD (one meal a day)
- 48-hour fasts
- Extended fasts (3-7 days)

Fasting on carnivore is effortless because you're fat-adapted.

**What to expect:**

**Month 4:**
- Stable energy, mood, focus
- Body composition at its best
- Inflammation minimal or gone
- You've hit your groove

**Month 6:**
- This is your new normal
- You can't imagine eating any other way
- Results plateau (you've achieved most benefits)

---

## The Rules That Matter

After coaching hundreds of beginners, these are the rules that determine success:

**Rule 1: Eat fatty meat, not lean**

Chicken breast and lean ground beef will make you miserable. You need fat for energy.

**Best cuts:**
- Ribeye, chuck roast, short ribs
- Ground beef (80/20 or 73/27)
- Pork belly, bacon
- Lamb chops

**Rule 2: Salt everything**

Low-carb depletes sodium. If you're not salting your food, you'll feel weak.

Add salt until it tastes good. You can't over-salt on carnivore.

**Rule 3: Don't restrict calories**

Carnivore is self-regulating. Eat until full. Your body will adjust.

Restricting calories in the first month will make adaptation brutal.

**Rule 4: Adapt before optimizing**

Don't add fasting, keto, or training intensity in week 1. Adapt first. Optimize later.

**Rule 5: Give it 90 days**

Most benefits take 2-3 months to show up. If you quit at week 3 because you feel tired, you'll never see the results.

Commit to 90 days. No cheating.

## Common Mistakes That Kill Progress

**Mistake 1: Not eating enough fat**

Beginners fear fat. They eat lean meat and wonder why they're starving.

Fat is your fuel. Eat fatty cuts.

**Mistake 2: Undereating**

"I'm only eating once a day and I feel terrible!"

You're undereating. Add a second meal.

**Mistake 3: Adding too many foods too soon**

You add eggs, dairy, pork, chicken, and fish in week 1. You feel terrible. You don't know what caused it.

Stick to beef for 30 days. Add foods one at a time after that.

**Mistake 4: Ignoring electrolytes**

"I've been carnivore for 2 weeks and I feel awful."

Did you add salt?

"No."

Add salt.

**Mistake 5: Training too hard during adaptation**

You try to hit PRs in week 2. Your lifts tank. You panic.

Reduce volume during adaptation. Maintain intensity, but fewer sets.

**Mistake 6: Quitting at week 3**

Week 3 is the worst. You're past the initial excitement, still adapting, and feel like garbage.

This is when most people quit.

Push through. Week 4 is when it clicks.

## Tracking Progress (Not Weight)

Don't obsess over the scale. Track these instead:

**Energy:**
- Consistent all day = fat-adapted
- Crashes at 2 PM = not adapted yet

**Hunger:**
- Naturally eating 1-2 meals/day = adapted
- Starving every 3 hours = not adapted

**Mental Clarity:**
- Sharp focus, no brain fog = adapted
- Foggy, distracted = still adapting

**Body Composition:**
- Leaner, more muscle definition = progress
- Scale weight might not change (muscle gained, fat lost)

**Inflammation:**
- Joint pain gone, skin clear = major win
- Still inflamed = give it more time or eliminate dairy/eggs

---

## The Bottom Line

Carnivore is simple. Eat meat. Add salt. Drink water. Give it 90 days.

The first month is hard. You'll feel worse before you feel better. That's adaptation.

By month 3, you'll be leaner, stronger, and mentally sharper than you've ever been.

And you'll wonder why you ever ate any other way.
