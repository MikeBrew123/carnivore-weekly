<!-- TL;DR Box -->
<div class="tldr-box">
    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting carnivore isn't about perfection—it's about execution. Eat beef, salt, and water for the first week.</li>
        <li>The danger zone is days 3-5 when adaptation kicks in. Electrolytes (especially salt) prevent most "keto flu" symptoms.</li>
        <li>Give it 30 days minimum before deciding if it works for you. Most people see real changes by day 90.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>If you're reading this on January 2nd and thinking "I want to try carnivore," you're not alone. Thirty percent of Reddit's carnivore traffic right now is people asking: "What should I eat?" and "Will this actually work for me?"</p>

<p>Here's what I've learned watching thousands of people start: most of them fail in week two, not because carnivore doesn't work, but because they didn't know what to expect. So let's fix that.</p>

<h2>Week 0: The Decision (Before You Start)</h2>

<p>Before you buy your first steak, answer this: Why are you doing this?</p>

<p>Not the Instagram answer. The real one. Are you fixing blood sugar crashes? Trying to lose weight? Dealing with digestive issues? Clearing brain fog? The answer matters because it changes what success looks like for you.</p>

<p>If your goal is fat loss, you're tracking weight and how clothes fit. If it's energy, you're noticing afternoon crashes disappearing. If it's inflammation, you're watching joint pain improve. Different goals mean different timelines for "this is working."</p>

<p>Also: Talk to your doctor. I mean this. If you're on medication—especially for blood sugar or blood pressure—you need medical oversight because carnivore changes how your body processes medication. Not a suggestion. Required.</p>

<h2>Week 1: The Simple Start</h2>

<p>Your job this week is to prove you can execute the diet. That's it. Not to be perfect. Not to hit perfect macros. Just to eat meat.</p>

<p><strong>What you eat:</strong> Beef, salt, water. That's your diet.</p>

<p>Specifically:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Breakfast: 6-8 oz ground beef with salt and water</li>
    <li>Lunch: 8-10 oz steak with salt and water</li>
    <li>Dinner: 10-12 oz beef roast or ground beef with salt and water</li>
    <li>Snacks if hungry: More beef, hard-boiled eggs, or canned sardines</li>
</ul>

<p>Why beef and salt? Because beef is the most nutrient-dense food available, salt prevents electrolyte crashes that cause headaches and fatigue, and water keeps everything moving. No complexity. No variables.</p>

<p><strong>How much to eat:</strong> Until you're satisfied, not stuffed. Your hunger signals will be weird for a few days. That's normal. Listen to satiety, not quantity.</p>

<p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Days 1-2: Probably fine. Some people feel great immediately.</li>
    <li>Days 3-5: This is the danger zone. You might feel foggy, tired, or get a headache. This is adaptation, not failure.</li>
    <li>Days 6-7: Energy usually starts returning. Sleep might be weird (too much or too little).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If you get a headache:</strong> Add salt (1/4 teaspoon with water) and eat more. Most "keto flu" is dehydration + electrolyte depletion, not the diet failing.</p>

<p><strong>If you feel nauseous:</strong> Eat less per meal, more frequently. Your digestion is adapting.</p>

</blockquote>

<h2>Week 2-4: The Adaptation Phase</h2>

<p>This is where your digestive system learns that you're only eating meat. Your gut bacteria shift. Your stomach acid production normalizes. Your liver adjusts to processing fat at scale.</p>

<p>This takes time. Not magic time. Physiological time. Your microbiota don't change overnight.</p>

<p><strong>What changes now:</strong> You can start experimenting. Try different beef sources. Add eggs. Try pork, lamb, or fish. See what feels good.</p>

<p>Most people find their preference: some do all beef, some do beef + eggs, some do beef + fish. All valid. The diet is "carnivore," not "only beef."</p>

<p><strong>Energy will fluctuate:</strong> Some days you feel amazing. Some days you're tired. That's normal for four weeks. Your metabolism is rewiring. Expect inconsistency.</p>

<p><strong>Your appetite might change:</strong> Some people eat less naturally. Some eat more. Your body is figuring out how much fuel it needs without constant blood sugar crashes.</p>

<p><strong>Sleep is usually weird for 3-4 weeks:</strong> Some people sleep 4 hours (not tired), some sleep 10 hours (catching up on deep sleep). Both are normal. Track it, don't fight it.</p>

<h2>The Electrolyte Reality</h2>

<p>This is the most important section because this is where people fail.</p>

<p>When you stop eating carbs, your body stops storing sodium (carbs bind water and sodium). You'll pee out water and electrolytes for 2-3 weeks. This is why you feel tired or get headaches.</p>

<p><strong>How to fix it:</strong> Salt your food. A lot. More than you think. Aim for 5-10 grams of sodium per day (that's 1-2 teaspoons of salt) for the first 3-4 weeks.</p>

<p>Yes, that sounds like a lot. It's not. You're not eating carbs, so you're not spiking insulin or retaining excess water. You need the sodium.</p>

<p><strong>Signs you're low on electrolytes:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Headaches</li>
    <li>Fatigue that doesn't improve with sleep</li>
    <li>Muscle cramps</li>
    <li>Dizziness</li>
</ul>

<p>Fix: Salt water (1/4 teaspoon in 8oz water) + food. Usually improves within 30 minutes.</p>

<h2>Tracking Progress (The Right Way)</h2>

<p>Don't just weigh yourself. Weight fluctuates 3-5 lbs daily based on water, hormones, digestion, and sodium. One number tells you almost nothing.</p>

<p><strong>What actually matters:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>How your clothes fit (waist, chest, arms) - more accurate than scale</li>
    <li>Energy levels throughout the day (rate 1-10)</li>
    <li>Hunger patterns (fasting easier? Less snacking?)</li>
    <li>Digestion (how are you feeling?)</li>
    <li>Sleep quality (not duration, quality)</li>
    <li>Mental clarity (is brain fog gone?)</li>
    <li>Mood stability (less mood swings?)</li>
</ul>

<p>Take a photo on day 1, day 30, and day 90. You'll see changes the scale won't show.</p>

<h2>Common Questions Answered</h2>

<p><strong>Q: Will my cholesterol get messed up?</strong><br>
A: It might change. Some people's LDL goes up, some goes down. Total cholesterol often goes down. HDL almost always goes up. The important metric is inflammation (triglycerides, apoB, hs-CRP), not total cholesterol. Get blood work at 30 and 90 days, compare to baseline.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How much do I actually need to eat?</strong><br>
A: Until satisfied. That's it. Hunger regulation usually improves after week 2. Most people eat less naturally without trying.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is it okay to do this with exercise?</strong><br>
A: Yes, but expect to feel flat for 2-3 weeks while adapting. Your glycogen stores are depleted. After that, many people feel stronger and more energetic. Some people do better with lighter training during adaptation week.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What if I get digestive issues?</strong><br>
A: Change your approach. Eat smaller meals, more frequently. Grind your meat instead of whole chunks. Try different beef sources (fatty vs. lean). Your digestion will adapt, but it takes time.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Can I do this vegetarian/vegan?</strong><br>
A: This is a diet based on animal foods. So no. You need meat, fish, or other animal products to do this correctly.</p>

<h2>The 90-Day Checkpoint</h2>

<p>By day 90, you'll know if this is working for you. You'll have:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Adapted metabolically (no more adaptation flu)</li>
    <li>Established your preferred food selections</li>
    <li>Seen measurable changes (weight, energy, how you look/feel)</li>
    <li>Built the habit (it's automatic now)</li>
    <li>Know how your body responds</li>
</ul>

<p>If you feel dramatically better at day 90, you've found something that works for you. If not, you have good data about why this isn't for you—and that's also valuable.</p>

<div class="key-takeaways">
    <h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start simple: beef, salt, water. Don't overcomplicate it in week one.</li>
        <li>Electrolytes matter more than you think—aim for 5-10g sodium daily during adaptation (weeks 1-4).</li>
        <li>Track what actually matters: energy levels, clothes fit, digestion quality—not just scale weight.</li>
        <li>Commit to 30 days minimum. Real adaptation takes 2-4 weeks, and you'll see the best results at day 90.</li>
    </ol>
</div>

<h2>What to Do Right Now</h2>

<p>Today, if you're starting:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Buy beef (ground or steak, fatty cuts are better)</li>
    <li>Buy salt</li>
    <li>Plan meals for the next 3 days</li>
    <li>Tell your doctor</li>
    <li>Take a baseline photo and write down how you feel right now</li>
    <li>Commit to 30 days minimum—not forever, just 30 days</li>
</ol>

<p>That's it. You're ready.</p>
