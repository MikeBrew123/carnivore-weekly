<h1>PSMF (Protein Sparing Modified Fasting): The Strategic Strike for Fat Loss Stalls</h1>

<p>You've been doing carnivore for three months. Lost fat cleanly. Then stopped. Nothing. Same weight for four weeks.</p>

<p>Your body adapted. That's actually a win, not a loss. But if you want to keep moving, you need a different stimulus.</p>

<p>Enter PSMF: Protein Sparing Modified Fasting. Not a lifestyle. A tool. A 2-4 week protocol to break the stall and restart the fat loss.</p>

<h2>What It Is</h2>

<p>PSMF is simple: Eat only protein. Carnivore style that means lean beef, fish, and eggs. No fat added. That's it.</p>

<p>Your calories drop significantly (usually 40% deficit). Your protein stays high (protecting muscle). Your body has no choice but to burn fat for energy.</p>

<p>Why it works: When you're in a calorie deficit on regular carnivore, you still have dietary fat available. Your body uses that first before mobilizing stored fat. On PSMF, there's no fat to use. Only protein. So your body burns your fat reserves hard and fast.</p>

<h2>The Protocol</h2>

<p>Simple breakdown:</p>

<p><strong>Protein target:</strong> 1.2-1.5g per pound of lean body mass. If you're 180 lbs at 15% body fat, that's roughly 150 lbs lean mass = 180-225g protein daily.</p>

<p><strong>Food options:</strong> Lean ground beef (93/7 or higher), fish, egg whites, chicken breast. That's it.</p>

<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 2-4 weeks maximum. Not longer. Your body needs the break and the full nutrition of regular carnivore after that.</p>

<p><strong>Training:</strong> Keep lifting heavy but lower volume slightly. You're in a deficit. Push too hard and you'll burn muscle. Maintain strength, not build new mass right now.</p>

<p><strong>Electrolytes:</strong> Non-negotiable. Double your normal intake. Sodium especially. When fat drops out of your diet, you lose electrolytes fast.</p>

<h2>What to Expect</h2>

<p><strong>Week 1:</strong> You'll feel flat. Energy dips. That's normal. Your body's adjusting. Don't panic.</p>

<p><strong>Week 2:</strong> Adaptation phase. Energy stabilizes. Workouts feel solid again. Fat loss accelerates. This is where it clicks.</p>

<p><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Continued fat loss. Strength holds. But you'll start craving the satiety of fat. Good sign. Your body's telling you to stop.</p>

<p><strong>Fat loss rate:</strong> Expect 2-4 pounds per week on PSMF. That's aggressive but sustainable for 2-4 weeks because you're preserving muscle with high protein.</p>

<h2>When to Use PSMF</h2>

<p>Only when you're truly stuck. Not after two weeks of plateau. Real stalls = 4+ weeks with no movement. If you're moving slowly but moving, keep your regular carnivore approach.</p>

<p>PSMF is the nuclear option. Effective but demanding. Use it strategically, not constantly.</p>

<h2>After PSMF</h2>

<p>When you hit your target or reach 3-4 weeks, transition back to regular carnivore. Reintroduce fat slowly. Your body will thank you.</p>

<p>Many people run PSMF once per year. Usually around this time (January/February) when they want to hit their spring goals hard.</p>

<p>The stall wasn't a failure. It was your body adapting. PSMF is the reset button. Use it. Then go back to sustainable eating.</p>
