<p>Okay, so Paul Saladino is all over your feed talking about honey, fruit, and raw milk. He used to be hardcore carnivore. Now he's calling it "animal-based" and adding carbs back in.</p>

<p>And you're wondering: Did he betray the movement? Or did he figure something out that strict carnivores are missing?</p>

                <div class="tldr-box tldr-box--green">
                    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Paul Saladino argues that some people (especially active people) do better with honey and fruit for carbs instead of zero-carb.</li>
                        <li>Strict carnivores say you don't need carbs at all if you're fat-adapted. Anecdotes support both sides.</li>
                        <li>The answer depends on your goals, activity level, and how you personally feel. There's no one-size-fits-all.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

<p>This debate is raging in the community right now. Let's break down both sides and what people are actually experiencing.</p>

<h2>What Paul Saladino Actually Says</h2>

<p>Paul's argument is this:</p>

<p><strong>1. Carbs aren't inherently bad. Processed food and seed oils are the problem.</strong></p>

<p>He thinks the issue with the Standard American Diet isn't carbs themselves, it's industrial foods. Honey and fruit are "clean" carbs that humans have eaten for thousands of years.</p>

<p><strong>2. Some people feel better with carbs, especially if they're active.</strong></p>

<p>His claim: Athletes, people who do intense exercise, and people with high stress might perform better with some glucose. Honey and fruit provide that without the downsides of grains or sugar.</p>

<p><strong>3. Electrolyte balance is easier with carbs.</strong></p>

<p>He argues that zero-carb carnivore can cause low aldosterone, which messes with sodium retention. Adding carbs helps your body hold onto electrolytes better.</p>

<p><strong>His protocol:</strong> Meat, organs, fruit, honey, raw dairy. No grains, no seed oils, no processed food. He calls it "animal-based" instead of carnivore.</p>

<h2>What Strict Carnivores Say</h2>

<p>The hardcore carnivore crowd (Shawn Baker, Ken Berry, Anthony Chaffee) has a different take:</p>

<p><strong>1. You don't need carbs. Humans are fat-adapted.</strong></p>

<p>Once you're fat-adapted (usually 3-6 months in), your body runs on fat and ketones. You don't need glucose. Your liver makes what little you need via gluconeogenesis.</p>

<p><strong>2. Honey and fruit are still sugar.</strong></p>

<p>Fructose from fruit goes straight to your liver and can cause the same metabolic issues as table sugar if you eat too much. Honey is basically glucose and fructose. It's not magic.</p>

                <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                    "The debate isn't really about science. It's about individual response. Some people thrive on zero-carb. Some people do better with a little fruit. Both can work."
                </blockquote>

<p><strong>3. Elimination diets work because you eliminate everything, not because you add things back.</strong></p>

<p>A lot of people come to carnivore because they have autoimmune issues, gut problems, or inflammation. Strict carnivore removes all plant foods, which removes all potential triggers. Adding fruit back in might reintroduce problems.</p>

<p><strong>Their protocol:</strong> Meat, water, salt. That's it. Maybe eggs and dairy if you tolerate them. No plants, no exceptions.</p>

<h2>What the Community Actually Experiences</h2>

<p>I've been watching this debate play out on Reddit, YouTube, and Discord for months. Here's what people are saying:</p>

<p><strong>People who feel better on strict carnivore (zero-carb):</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li>"I tried adding honey back in and my skin broke out again. Strict carnivore keeps me clear."</li>
    <li>"Carbs make me hungry. Zero-carb keeps my appetite stable and I don't overeat."</li>
    <li>"I came to carnivore to heal my gut. Adding fruit back gave me bloating and gas."</li>
    <li>"I feel mentally sharper on zero-carb. Ketones are better brain fuel for me."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>People who feel better on animal-based (with carbs):</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li>"I do CrossFit 5 days a week. Adding honey pre-workout gave me my performance back."</li>
    <li>"Zero-carb made me feel flat and low-energy. A little fruit fixed it."</li>
    <li>"I was getting insomnia and heart palpitations on strict carnivore. Adding carbs fixed my electrolytes."</li>
    <li>"I'm a woman and zero-carb tanked my hormones. Adding fruit brought my cycle back."</li>
</ul>

<p>Both groups exist. Both are telling the truth about their own experience.</p>

<h2>Who Might Benefit from Animal-Based (Adding Carbs)</h2>

<p>Based on what the community reports, these groups tend to do better with some carbs:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li><strong>Athletes and highly active people:</strong> If you're doing intense training, glycogen helps. Honey or fruit can top off your stores without reintroducing processed carbs.</li>
    <li><strong>Women with hormonal issues:</strong> Some women report better cycle regularity and thyroid function with carbs. This isn't universal, but it's common enough to notice.</li>
    <li><strong>People struggling with electrolyte imbalances:</strong> If you're getting heart palpitations, dizziness, or insomnia despite supplementing salt, carbs might help you retain electrolytes better.</li>
    <li><strong>People who were very lean before starting:</strong> If you don't have much body fat to burn, adding carbs can provide quick energy while you build up fat stores.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who Should Probably Stick to Strict Carnivore</h2>

<p>These groups tend to do better on zero-carb:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li><strong>People with autoimmune conditions:</strong> Elimination works because you eliminate everything. Adding plants back in can reintroduce triggers.</li>
    <li><strong>People with insulin resistance or diabetes:</strong> Carbs spike insulin. If you're metabolically broken, zero-carb keeps insulin low and stable.</li>
    <li><strong>People trying to lose significant weight:</strong> Zero-carb makes appetite control easier. Adding carbs can trigger cravings and overeating.</li>
    <li><strong>People with gut issues (IBS, SIBO, Crohn's):</strong> Fiber and fructose can feed bad bacteria. Strict carnivore starves them out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Nuanced Take</h2>

<p>Here's what I think is actually happening:</p>

<p>The debate isn't really about science. It's about individual response. Some people thrive on zero-carb. Some people do better with a little fruit. Both can work.</p>

<p>Paul Saladino is a super active guy who surfs and works out constantly. For him, carbs improve performance. That doesn't mean everyone needs them.</p>

<p>Shawn Baker is also super active (he's a former pro athlete). He thrives on zero-carb. That doesn't mean carbs are inherently bad.</p>

<p>Different people, different results.</p>

<h2>How to Figure Out What Works for You</h2>

<p>If you're new to carnivore, start strict. Meat, water, salt. Give it 90 days.</p>

<p>Why? Because you need to establish a baseline. You need to be fully fat-adapted before you can assess whether carbs help or hurt.</p>

<p>After 90 days, if you're feeling great, keep going. If you're struggling with energy, sleep, or hormones, you can experiment with adding carbs back in.</p>

<p>One thing that helps when testing: knowing your baseline macros. Most people starting carnivore have no idea how much protein or fat they're actually eating. Then when they add carbs, they can't tell what changed because nothing was measured.</p>

<p>If you want to track this properly, we built a <a href="/calculator.html" style="color: var(--color-oxblood); text-decoration: underline;">free calculator</a> that gives you personalized macros for strict carnivore or animal-based. Takes about 2 minutes, no email required. You can test zero-carb for 90 days, then rerun it with carbs added and compare how you feel on both protocols.</p>

<p>You don't need it if you're fine winging it. But if you're the type who wants data, it's there.</p>

<p><strong>How to test:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li>Add one source of carbs at a time. Honey first, or fruit. Don't add both at once.</li>
    <li>Start small. 1-2 tablespoons of honey, or one piece of fruit per day.</li>
    <li>Track how you feel. Energy, sleep, digestion, skin, mood.</li>
    <li>If it helps, keep it. If it causes problems, remove it again.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is your body. You get to decide what works.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Paul Saladino isn't wrong. But he's not universally right either.</p>

<p>For some people, adding honey and fruit improves performance and well-being. For others, it reintroduces cravings, inflammation, and metabolic problems.</p>

<p>The community is split because both approaches work for different people.</p>

<p>If strict carnivore is working for you, you don't need to change. If you're struggling and suspect carbs might help, you can test it without abandoning the core principles: prioritize animal foods, avoid processed junk, listen to your body.</p>

<p>That's the real lesson here. There's no one perfect protocol. There's only what works for you.</p>
