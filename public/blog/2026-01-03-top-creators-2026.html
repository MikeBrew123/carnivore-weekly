                Okay, so it's 2026 and the carnivore YouTube space has evolved. Some channels have grown massive. Some have pivoted. Some have disappeared entirely.

I spent the last week binge-watching the top carnivore creators to see what they're teaching now. Here's what the biggest names are focusing on in 2026, and what you should actually pay attention to.

## The Big 5: Channels Every Carnivore Watches

### 1. Dr. Shawn Baker (@shawn_baker)

**What he's teaching in 2026:**

Shawn's still the carnivore ambassador. His focus is the same: performance, strength, and anecdotal data.

**Recent video themes:**
- "Why Your Doctor Is Wrong About <a href="/wiki/#cholesterol" class="wiki-link">Cholesterol</a>" (500k views)
- "Carnivore for Athletes: The Science of Fat Adaptation" (300k views)
- "Breaking Down the Latest Carnivore Study" (400k views)

**What's new:**

Shawn's leaning more into scientific studies. He used to rely heavily on anecdotes and self-experimentation. Now he's citing research papers and bringing on scientists.

He's also pushing back hard on the "carnivore is dangerous" narrative. Lots of videos debunking <a href="/wiki/#critics" class="wiki-link">vegan</a> doctors and mainstream nutrition advice.

**Should you watch?**

Yes, if you want:
- Performance and fitness content
- Confidence to push back against doctors who freak out over your diet
- Motivation to stick with carnivore

Skip if you want:
- Deep nutrition science (Shawn keeps it high-level)
- Specific protocols for health conditions

**Best video to start:**
"How to Talk to Your Doctor About Carnivore" — practical advice for navigating medical appointments.

---

### 2. Dr. Paul Saladino (@paulsaladinomd)

**What he's teaching in 2026:**

Paul's no longer pure carnivore. He's fully "animal-based" now, which means meat + fruit + honey.

**Recent video themes:**
- "Why I Eat 300g of Carbs on Animal-Based" (800k views)
- "The Thyroid Problem with Zero-Carb" (600k views)
- "How to Optimize Testosterone with Fruit and Meat" (500k views)

**What's new:**

Paul's gone all-in on the "low-carb damages thyroid" argument. He claims strict carnivore (zero-carb) can suppress T3 and cortisol, especially in lean people.

His solution: Add fruit and honey to maintain metabolic health.

**The controversy:**

A lot of strict carnivores think Paul's backtracking or selling out. Others think he's evolving based on new data.

**Should you watch?**

Yes, if you:
- Are lean and active (BMI < 23) and experiencing low T3 or energy crashes
- Are open to adding carbs back in the form of fruit/honey
- Want to hear the scientific case for carbs on a meat-based diet

Skip if you:
- Want strict carnivore advice
- Believe zero-carb is optimal for everyone
- Don't care about thyroid optimization

**Best video to start:**
"The Thyroid Problem with Zero-Carb" — explains Paul's rationale for adding carbs.

### 3. Steak and Butter Gal (@steakandbuttergal)

**What she's teaching in 2026:**

Bella's focus is women's health, hormones, and simplicity.

**Recent video themes:**
- "How Carnivore Fixed My PCOS" (1M views)
- "Why Your Period Stopped on Carnivore (And What to Do)" (700k views)
- "The Carnivore Glow: Skin Changes After 1 Year" (500k views)

**What's new:**

Bella's leaning into the aesthetic benefits of carnivore: skin, hair, body composition.

She's also one of the few creators addressing the "period stopped on carnivore" issue openly. She talks about hypothalamic amenorrhea, calorie intake, and body fat percentage.

**Should you watch?**

Yes, if you:
- Are a woman dealing with hormonal issues (PCOS, irregular periods, PMS)
- Want to see real before/after transformations
- Prefer simple, no-BS advice (Bella doesn't overcomplicate things)

Skip if you:
- Want deep scientific explanations (Bella is anecdotal)
- Are looking for male-specific content (performance, strength, etc.)

**Best video to start:**
"How Carnivore Fixed My PCOS" — her personal story and what worked.

---

### 4. Kelly Hogan (@myzerocarblife)

**What she's teaching in 2026:**

Kelly's the OG carnivore mom. She's been zero-carb for 15+ years and has 3 kids raised on carnivore.

**Recent video themes:**
- "Raising Kids on Carnivore: 15 Years Later" (400k views)
- "Carnivore on a Budget: My Grocery Haul" (300k views)
- "Why I Don't Eat Vegetables (And Neither Should You)" (500k views)

**What's new:**

Kelly's doubling down on simplicity and budget-friendly carnivore. She's showing people how to do this without spending $200/week on ribeyes.

Her content is very family-focused now. Lots of videos about feeding kids, meal prep, and navigating social situations.

**Should you watch?**

Yes, if you:
- Have kids and want to see how to feed them on carnivore
- Are on a tight budget
- Want long-term success stories (Kelly's been carnivore since 2009)

Skip if you:
- Want cutting-edge science or advanced protocols
- Are looking for performance/fitness content

**Best video to start:**
"Carnivore on a Budget: My Grocery Haul" — practical tips for saving money.

---

### 5. Bart Kay (@bart_kay)

**What he's teaching in 2026:**

Bart's the most aggressive critic of mainstream nutrition science. He's a biomedical scientist who tears apart vegan studies and debunks nutrition myths.

**Recent video themes:**
- "Debunking the Latest 'Meat Causes Cancer' Study" (600k views)
- "Why the Blue Zones Are a Lie" (800k views)
- "The Fiber Myth: Why You Don't Need It" (500k views)

**What's new:**

Bart's ramped up his takedowns of vegan influencers and bad science. He's known for calling out cherry-picked studies and flawed research.

His tone is very confrontational. Some people love it. Others find him abrasive.

**Should you watch?**

Yes, if you:
- Want to understand how to critique nutrition studies
- Are tired of vegan propaganda and want solid counterarguments
- Enjoy aggressive, no-BS debunking

Skip if you:
- Want motivational or beginner-friendly content
- Don't care about scientific debates

**Best video to start:**
"Why the Blue Zones Are a Lie" — dismantles the Blue Zones myth with data.

## The Rising Stars: Creators to Watch in 2026

### Dr. Anthony Chaffee (@anthonychaffeemd)

**Why he's blowing up:**

Anthony's a neurosurgeon who went carnivore to reverse his own health issues. He's articulate, calm, and science-focused.

**What he's teaching:**
- Carnivore for autoimmune diseases
- Neurological benefits of meat-based diets
- How to talk to doctors about carnivore

**Best video:**
"Carnivore Diet and the Brain" — explains how ketones improve neurological health.

**Watch if:** You want science-backed content delivered calmly.

---

### Judy Cho (@nutritionwithjudy)

**Why she's blowing up:**

Judy's a functional nutritionist who works with carnivore clients. She focuses on root cause analysis and personalized protocols.

**What she's teaching:**
- Why some people need organ meats (and others don't)
- How to troubleshoot carnivore when it's not working
- Advanced bloodwork interpretation

**Best video:**
"Why Your Carnivore Diet Isn't Working" — troubleshooting guide.

**Watch if:** You've been carnivore for months and aren't seeing results.

---

### Bella (@belladelfigalo)

**Why she's blowing up:**

Bella's a fitness coach who documents her carnivore journey in real-time. She's relatable, honest, and doesn't sugarcoat the hard parts.

**What she's teaching:**
- Carnivore for women's fitness
- Body recomposition (losing fat, building muscle)
- Real-time adaptation struggles

**Best video:**
"My First 30 Days on Carnivore (The Good and the Bad)" — honest account of adaptation.

**Watch if:** You want to see someone going through the same struggles you are.

## The Controversial Takes: What Creators Are Arguing About

### **Debate 1: Zero-Carb vs. Animal-Based**

**Zero-Carb Camp (Shawn Baker, Kelly Hogan):**
"Carbs are unnecessary. Meat, salt, water. That's it."

**Animal-Based Camp (Paul Saladino):**
"Zero-carb can suppress thyroid and stress hormones. Add fruit and honey for optimal health."

**Who's right?**

Depends on you. If you're lean, active, and experiencing low T3 or energy crashes, Paul's approach might work. If you're overweight or insulin resistant, zero-carb is probably better.

---

### **Debate 2: Dairy or No Dairy?**

**Pro-Dairy Camp (Steak and Butter Gal):**
"Dairy is carnivore-friendly. Butter, heavy cream, cheese. It's from animals."

**Anti-Dairy Camp (Bart Kay):**
"Dairy is for calves, not humans. It causes inflammation and digestive issues."

**Who's right?**

Test it yourself. If you tolerate dairy (no bloating, no acne, no digestive upset), keep it. If not, ditch it.

---

### **Debate 3: Organ Meats—Necessary or Optional?**

**Pro-Organs Camp (Paul Saladino, Judy Cho):**
"Organs are the most nutrient-dense foods. You need them for optimal health."

**Anti-Organs Camp (Shawn Baker, Kelly Hogan):**
"Muscle meat is enough. Organs are optional."

**Who's right?**

If you're eating fatty muscle meat (ribeye, ground beef), you're probably fine without organs. If you want to optimize, add liver once a week.

---

## What the Creators Aren't Talking About (But Should Be)

**1. Long-Term Carnivore Data**

Most creators have been carnivore for 3-10 years. We don't have 20- or 30-year data on all-meat diets.

What happens to bones, kidneys, and heart health after decades of zero-carb? We don't know yet.

**2. Genetic Variability**

Some people thrive on zero-carb. Others need carbs. Creators rarely talk about APOE4, MTHFR, and other genetic factors that affect how you respond to carnivore.

**3. The Cost Barrier**

Most creators eat ribeyes and grass-fed beef. That's expensive.

Few creators address the reality that carnivore can be prohibitively expensive for low-income families.

**4. Social Isolation**

Carnivore is lonely. You can't eat out easily. You can't share meals with non-carnivore friends.

Most creators gloss over this. It's a real issue.

## The Bottom Line: Who Should You Follow?

**If you want motivation and big-picture thinking:** Shawn Baker
**If you're interested in animal-based (meat + fruit):** Paul Saladino
**If you're a woman with hormonal issues:** Steak and Butter Gal
**If you're a parent or on a budget:** Kelly Hogan
**If you want to debunk vegan propaganda:** Bart Kay
**If you want advanced troubleshooting:** Judy Cho
**If you want relatable, real-time content:** Bella

**My recommendation:**

Follow 2-3 creators max. Don't consume conflicting advice from 10 different people. It'll just confuse you.

Pick the creators whose content aligns with your goals (performance, women's health, budget, science, etc.) and stick with them.

And remember: YouTube is great for education, but **your own experience is the best teacher.**

If something works for you, keep doing it. If it doesn't, adjust.
