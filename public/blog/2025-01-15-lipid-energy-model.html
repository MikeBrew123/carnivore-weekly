Lean. Muscular. No effort, just eating meat.</p><p>Others struggle. They don't lose fat as easily. They feel tired. Something's off.</p><p>The difference is often the lipid energy model and how well you're adapted to burning fat.</p><h2>The Model</h2><p>Your body can run on two fuels: glucose and lipids (fat). Most people default to glucose. Their bodies are "glucose dependent."</p><p>On carnivore, you're forcing an adaptation to lipids. Some bodies adapt easily (hyper-responders). Some take longer.</p><p>Hyper-responders feel amazing immediately. Energy up. Fat dropping. Performance improving.</p><p>Non-responders take longer. They need more electrolytes, more fat, more patience.</p><h2>How to Know Which You Are</h2><p>Week one of carnivore: Do you feel amazing or do you feel flat?</p><p>If you feel amazing, you're responding well to lipid energy. Lean in. Keep going.</p><p>If you feel flat, your body's still trying to adapt. Increase electrolytes and fat. Give it time.</p><p>—Sarah</p></body></html>
