<h1>The Carnivore Bar Guide: What to Order When the Squad is Drinking</h1>

<p>You're on carnivore. Your friends want to hit the bar on Friday. Everyone's ordering cocktails and appetizers. You're sitting there like, what do I even order?</p>

<p>Good news: bars are actually way easier than restaurants. You don't need the menu. You just need to know what works.</p>

<h2>The Drink Situation</h2>

<p><strong>Spirits straight:</strong> This is your friend. Whiskey, vodka, gin, tequila, rum. Order neat, on the rocks, or with a splash of seltzer. Zero carbs. Perfectly carnivore.</p>

<p><strong>Seltzer and salt:</strong> If you're drinking spirits, ask for seltzer on the side with a salt shaker. Sounds weird but trust me, it keeps your electrolytes balanced through the night. Your body will thank you Saturday morning.</p>

<p><strong>Beer:</strong> Most beers are 3-6g carbs per drink. Technically fine if you're tracking, but also kind of annoying at a bar when you're supposed to be relaxing. Skip it.</p>

<p><strong>Wine:</strong> Red wine is usually 3-4g carbs per glass. White is 2-3g. Dry is better than sweet. But again, it's carbs. Not ideal.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid completely:</strong> Anything with a name that sounds fun (mojitos, margaritas, cosmopolitans). Those are carb bombs. Pass.</p>

<h2>The Food Situation</h2>

<p><strong>Bar snacks that work:</strong> Pork rinds (if they have them), beef jerky (ask), nuts (usually available), cheese (yes). Don't be shy about asking what they have.</p>

<p><strong>Actual food to order:</strong> Steak bites, wings, meatballs, bacon. Ask the bartender what meat-based appetizers they have. Most bars have something.</p>

<p><strong>The fries situation:</strong> Your friends are ordering nachos and fries. You're ordering steak. You're the boring one at the table. Accept this. Your health is boring and that's fine.</p>

<p><strong>Avoid:</strong> Anything breaded, fried, or with sauce that smells sugary. Wings coated in honey garlic? Nope. Sliders on buns? Obviously not. Bruschetta? Come on.</p>

<h2>The Social Part</h2>

<p>Here's the thing nobody talks about: ordering drinks at a bar without alcohol is totally normal now. Order a seltzer and lime. Add some salt. Nobody cares.</p>

<p>If someone asks why you're not drinking, you have options: "Not drinking tonight," "I'm driving," "Just keeping it light." You don't owe anyone carnivore education at a bar.</p>

<p>If you do want a drink, have one. This isn't about perfection. It's about knowing your options so you can make good decisions instead of just going along with whatever.</p>

<p>Most people on carnivore drink less naturally anyway. Your tolerance changes. Have one drink instead of three. Feel better Saturday morning. Win.</p>

<h2>The Whistler Bar Guide (Specific Props)</h2>

<p>If you're in Whistler or anywhere similar, figure out which bar has good steak or wings. Go there. The bartenders at good spots will work with you. Ask for what you want. They'll figure it out.</p>

<h2>Pro Tips</h2>

<p><strong>Pre-game at home:</strong> Eat a steak or some eggs before you go out. You're not going there hungry. This prevents bad decisions.</p>

<p><strong>Pace yourself:</strong> Alternate drinks with seltzer. You'll stay hydrated, feel better, and remember the night.</p>

<p><strong>Leave early:</strong> You don't need to stay until last call. Hit the bar, have a drink or two, hang with your friends, head home. Done.</p>

<p><strong>Next morning:</strong> You'll feel fine because you didn't drink much and you stayed hydrated. Meanwhile everyone else is hungover. This is the actual win.</p>

<h2>The Real Take</h2>

<p>Carnivore doesn't mean you can't have a social life. It means you're strategic about it instead of just going along with what everyone else is doing. Order what works for you. Don't apologize. Your friends won't care. And you'll feel way better.</p>

<p>Plus, you get to be the person who stays sharp while everyone else gets sloppy. Kind of an edge.</p>
