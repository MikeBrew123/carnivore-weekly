<h2>The Carb Question Everyone Asks</h2>

<p>Do you need carbs to perform? Short answer: no. Longer answer: it depends on what you're doing and how adapted you are.</p>

<p>Here's what works for fueling workouts on carnivore, based on what actually performs in the gym, not what diet influencers claim.</p>

<h2>Fat Adaptation: The First 8 Weeks Matter</h2>

<p>If you just started carnivore and you're trying to PR your deadlift, you're going to have a bad time.</p>

<p>Your body is switching from burning glucose to burning fat. This transition takes time. For most people, 4-8 weeks minimum. Athletes who train hard might take longer.</p>

<p>What to expect during adaptation:</p>

<p><strong>Weeks 1-2:</strong> Strength drops. Endurance tanks. You'll feel weaker. This is normal. Your glycogen is depleted and your body hasn't figured out how to efficiently use fat yet.</p>

<p><strong>Weeks 3-4:</strong> Strength starts coming back. You're not setting records, but you're not struggling through basic lifts anymore.</p>

<p><strong>Weeks 5-8:</strong> Performance normalizes. Most people report getting back to baseline strength and endurance.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond 8 weeks:</strong> This is where it gets interesting. Some people exceed their previous performance. Others plateau at baseline. Individual response varies.</p>

<p>Don't try to maintain peak performance while your body is adapting. Lower the volume, lower the intensity, and let your metabolism adjust.</p>

<h2>Pre-Workout: Timing and What to Eat</h2>

<p>The old bodybuilding advice says eat carbs 2 hours before training. On carnivore, that doesn't apply.</p>

<p>What works:</p>

<p><strong>Fasted Training:</strong> If you're fully adapted (8+ weeks), training fasted works fine for most people. No food, just water and electrolytes. Your body has enough stored fat to fuel the session.</p>

<p>This works best for strength training and moderate cardio. High-intensity interval work might suffer without any pre-workout fuel.</p>

<p><strong>Small Protein Meal (1-2 hours out):</strong> Eggs, ground beef, or a small steak. Enough to give you energy without sitting heavy in your stomach. Keep it simple and easy to digest.</p>

<p><strong>Larger Meal (3-4 hours out):</strong> If you prefer training with food in your system, eat a full meal several hours before. Ribeye, ground beef with eggs, whatever your normal meal is. Just give it time to digest.</p>

<p><strong>What Not to Do:</strong> Don't eat a massive steak 30 minutes before squatting. Your digestion will compete with your workout and both will suffer.</p>

<h2>Electrolytes: Non-Negotiable</h2>

<p>Carnivore is diuretic. You lose sodium, potassium, and magnesium faster than on a standard diet. When you add training on top of that, electrolyte needs go up significantly.</p>

<p>Pre-workout electrolytes prevent cramping, maintain performance, and keep your energy stable.</p>

<p>Simple approach: Salt your food heavily. Add an electrolyte drink (LMNT or similar) 30-60 minutes before training. If you're training hard or in heat, add another during or after.</p>

<p>Signs you need more electrolytes: cramping, headache, dizziness, sudden energy drop mid-workout. Don't ignore these. Add salt and electrolytes immediately.</p>

<h2>Intra-Workout: Do You Need Anything?</h2>

<p>For most training sessions under 90 minutes, you don't need to eat or drink anything except water and maybe electrolytes.</p>

<p>If you're doing long endurance sessions (2+ hours), some people add beef broth or bone broth for sodium and a bit of protein. This is more relevant for ultra-runners or cyclists, not typical gym sessions.</p>

<p>For strength training, lifting heavy for an hour, you don't need intra-workout nutrition. Just stay hydrated.</p>

<h2>Post-Workout: Protein Timing</h2>

<p>The fitness industry obsesses over the "anabolic window." Eat protein within 30 minutes or your gains disappear. This is mostly nonsense.</p>

<p>What actually matters: total daily protein intake. Timing is secondary.</p>

<p>That said, eating after training makes sense for practical reasons. You're hungry, your body is primed to use nutrients, and it's a convenient time to get a meal in.</p>

<p><strong>Ideal Post-Workout Meal:</strong> Protein and fat. Steak and eggs. Ground beef. Burger patties. Whatever meat you prefer. Aim for at least 30-40g of protein, more if you're bigger or training hard.</p>

<p><strong>How Soon:</strong> Within 2 hours is fine. If you're not hungry immediately after training, don't force it. Eat when you're ready.</p>

<p><strong>What to Avoid:</strong> Don't go 6 hours post-workout without eating. Your body needs protein to recover. But you also don't need to panic if you can't eat immediately.</p>

<h2>Total Daily Protein: What You Actually Need</h2>

<p>More important than timing: are you eating enough protein overall?</p>

<p>General guidelines for people training regularly:</p>

<p><strong>Sedentary or light activity:</strong> 0.8-1.0g per pound of bodyweight<br>
<strong>Moderate training (3-4 days/week):</strong> 1.0-1.2g per pound<br>
<strong>Heavy training (5-6 days/week):</strong> 1.2-1.5g per pound<br>
<strong>Athletes or very high volume:</strong> 1.5-2.0g per pound</p>

<p>These are starting points. Adjust based on how you feel and whether you're recovering well.</p>

<p>On carnivore, hitting these numbers is easy. A pound of ground beef has roughly 80-100g of protein. Two pounds gets most people to their target.</p>

<h2>Strength Training on Carnivore</h2>

<p>Powerlifting, bodybuilding, general strength work - carnivore works fine for all of it once you're adapted.</p>

<p><strong>What works:</strong></p>

<p>Heavy compounds (squat, deadlift, bench, overhead press) - No issues. Strength comes back after adaptation and often exceeds previous levels.</p>

<p>Volume training - As long as you're eating enough and recovering, high-volume hypertrophy work is sustainable.</p>

<p>Progressive overload - Add weight or reps over time like you normally would. The diet doesn't change the principles of strength training.</p>

<p><strong>What to watch:</strong></p>

<p>Recovery - Some people find they need more sleep or rest days on carnivore. Listen to your body. If you're beat up, take a day off.</p>

<p>Protein intake - Make sure you're eating enough. If your lifts are stalling and you're recovered, check if you're undereating protein.</p>

<h2>Endurance Training on Carnivore</h2>

<p>This is where opinions split. Some endurance athletes thrive on carnivore. Others struggle.</p>

<p><strong>Moderate endurance (5-10 miles, 1-2 hour sessions):</strong> Most people adapt fine. Steady-state cardio at moderate intensity works once you're fat-adapted.</p>

<p><strong>High-intensity intervals (sprints, HIIT, CrossFit):</strong> Harder. These rely more on glycogen. Some people perform fine, others report a permanent performance hit. Individual variation is high here.</p>

<p><strong>Ultra-endurance (marathons, ultra-runs, long cycling):</strong> Fat is excellent fuel for long, slow efforts. Many ultra-runners report improved performance on low-carb or carnivore because fat provides steady energy without the crashes.</p>

<p>If you're doing serious endurance work, give yourself 12+ weeks to adapt fully before judging performance.</p>

<h2>Creatine: Should You Supplement?</h2>

<p>Meat contains creatine. If you're eating 2+ pounds of beef per day, you're getting some creatine from your diet.</p>

<p>But it's not as much as supplementing 5g/day. If you're training for strength or power, creatine monohydrate is one of the most researched and effective supplements available.</p>

<p>It's not required on carnivore, but it helps. If you're serious about performance, it's worth adding.</p>

<h2>Common Performance Issues and Fixes</h2>

<p><strong>Problem: Energy crash mid-workout</strong><br>
Fix: Electrolytes. Add salt and potassium before training. Dehydration and electrolyte depletion are the most common causes of energy crashes.</p>

<p><strong>Problem: Not recovering between sessions</strong><br>
Fix: Eat more. Most people undereat when they start carnivore. If you're training hard, you need more food than you think.</p>

<p><strong>Problem: Strength not coming back after 8 weeks</strong><br>
Fix: Check protein intake. Check sleep. Check stress. If all of those are dialed in and you're still struggling, consider adding some carbs around training and see if it helps. Not everyone thrives on zero-carb.</p>

<p><strong>Problem: Cramping during training</strong><br>
Fix: Electrolytes again. Specifically sodium and potassium. This is almost always an electrolyte issue, not a diet issue.</p>

<h2>Do You Need Carbs for Performance?</h2>

<p>Most people don't. Once adapted, your body produces enough glucose through gluconeogenesis (making glucose from protein) to fuel even intense training.</p>

<p>But some athletes - especially those doing very high-intensity work - report better performance with targeted carbs around training.</p>

<p>If you've been strict carnivore for 3+ months, your training is dialed in, and you're still hitting a performance wall, experiment with adding a small amount of carbs (honey, fruit, white rice) around your workout and see if it helps.</p>

<p>This isn't required. Most people perform fine without it. But it's an option if strict carnivore isn't supporting your performance goals.</p>

<h2>What Actually Matters</h2>

<p>Strip away the debates and here's what determines performance on carnivore:</p>

<p>Give yourself time to adapt. Don't judge performance in week 2.</p>

<p>Eat enough protein. Most people need more than they think.</p>

<p>Prioritize electrolytes. Sodium, potassium, magnesium - all critical for performance and recovery.</p>

<p>Sleep and recovery matter more than meal timing. Get 7-8 hours, manage stress, take rest days when needed.</p>

<p>Track your performance. If lifts are going up, recovery is good, and you feel strong, the diet is working. If not, adjust.</p>

<p>Carnivore supports performance for most people once adapted. It's not magic, but it's not a handicap either. Train smart, eat enough, recover well, and the results will come.</p>
