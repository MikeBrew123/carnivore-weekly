<p>You don't need ribeyes and grass-fed beef to eat carnivore. You need ground beef, eggs, and a plan. Here's the exact math and protocol for thriving on carnivore for $7 per day.</p>

<h2>The Reality Check</h2>

<p>The carnivore diet gets labeled as expensive. People see influencers eating wagyu and organ meats shipped from New Zealand and think, "I can't afford that." You're right. You can't. Neither can most people doing carnivore.</p>

<p>The truth? You can eat carnivore cheaper than the Standard American Diet. Way cheaper. Ground beef and eggs are two of the most nutrient-dense, cost-effective foods on the planet. You just need to stop chasing perfection and focus on what works.</p>

<h2>The $7/Day Protocol</h2>

<p>Here's the breakdown. This isn't theoretical. These are real prices from regular grocery stores (not Whole Foods, not specialty shops).</p>

<p><strong>Daily Food:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>1.5 lbs ground beef (73/27 or 80/20): $4.50</li>
<li>6 large eggs: $2.50</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total: $7.00/day</strong></p>

<p>That's $210/month. For reference, the average American spends $250-$400 per month on food. You're eating better and spending less.</p>

<h2>The Macros</h2>

<p>Let's break down what you're actually getting.</p>

<p><strong>Ground Beef (73/27, 1.5 lbs):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Calories: ~1,300</li>
<li>Protein: ~95g</li>
<li>Fat: ~105g</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eggs (6 large):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Calories: ~420</li>
<li>Protein: ~36g</li>
<li>Fat: ~30g</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Total Daily Macros:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Calories: ~1,720</li>
<li>Protein: ~131g</li>
<li>Fat: ~135g</li>
</ul>

<p>This is solid for someone eating at maintenance or in a slight deficit. If you're training hard or need more calories, add another half-pound of ground beef ($1.50). Still under $9/day.</p>

<h2>Why Ground Beef + Eggs Works</h2>

<p>This isn't just cheap. It's nutritionally complete.</p>

<p><strong>Ground beef</strong> gives you heme iron, B12, zinc, creatine, and quality protein. The fat ratio (73/27 or 80/20) provides energy and keeps you full. Fattier ground beef is cheaper and more satiating. Win-win.</p>

<p><strong>Eggs</strong> fill in the gaps. Choline, vitamin A, selenium, biotin. They're one of the most bioavailable protein sources you can eat. Six eggs per day gives you everything you need without breaking the bank.</p>

<p>Together? You're covered. No deficiencies. No need for expensive supplements. Just meat and eggs.</p>

<h2>The Meal Plan</h2>

<p>You don't need variety. You need consistency. Here's how I'd structure it:</p>

<p><strong>Meal 1 (Morning):</strong> 4 eggs, scrambled or fried in butter</p>

<p><strong>Meal 2 (Afternoon):</strong> 1 lb ground beef, cooked however you like (pan-fried, boiled, grilled)</p>

<p><strong>Meal 3 (Evening):</strong> 0.5 lb ground beef + 2 eggs</p>

<p>Or skip the structure entirely and eat when you're hungry. OMAD? Two meals? Doesn't matter. The food stays the same.</p>

<h2>Shopping Strategy</h2>

<p>Don't buy one week at a time. Buy in bulk when prices drop.</p>

<p><strong>Ground beef:</strong> Watch for sales. When 73/27 or 80/20 hits $2.50-$3/lb, buy 20-30 lbs. Freeze what you don't use. Your cost per day drops even lower.</p>

<p><strong>Eggs:</strong> Buy 5-dozen flats when they're cheap. Eggs last weeks in the fridge. Stock up.</p>

<p>If you have a Costco membership, this gets even cheaper. A 10-lb pack of ground beef runs $25-$30. Five dozen eggs for $8-$10. Do the math. You're under $6/day.</p>

<h2>What About Variety?</h2>

<p>You don't need it. Not at first. Your body adapts fast. After two weeks, ground beef and eggs stop feeling monotonous. They start feeling like fuel.</p>

<p>That said, if you want to mix it up:</p>

<ul>
<li>Different seasonings (salt, garlic powder, paprika)</li>
<li>Cooking methods (pan-fry, bake, grill)</li>
<li>Egg prep (scrambled, fried, hard-boiled)</li>
</ul>

<p>Small changes keep it interesting without adding cost.</p>

<h2>What If I Want to Upgrade?</h2>

<p>Once you're stable on the $7/day protocol, you can add extras without blowing your budget.</p>

<p><strong>Organ meats:</strong> Beef liver is $2-$3/lb. Add 4 oz per week for micronutrients. Cost: $0.50-$0.75/week.</p>

<p><strong>Butter or tallow:</strong> Cook your ground beef and eggs in it. Adds flavor and fat. A pound of butter lasts a week. Cost: $1-$2/week.</p>

<p><strong>Occasional steak:</strong> Got an extra $5-$10? Buy a cheap chuck steak. Not necessary, but nice to have.</p>

<p>Even with upgrades, you're still under $10/day. Compare that to takeout, meal kits, or processed foods. It's not even close.</p>

<h2>Common Objections</h2>

<p><strong>"Ground beef isn't grass-fed."</strong> So what? Grass-fed is better, sure. But regular ground beef still works. You're eating whole animal foods. That alone puts you ahead of 90% of people. Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.</p>

<p><strong>"I'll get bored."</strong> Maybe. Or maybe you'll realize food doesn't need to be entertainment. It's fuel. Eat, feel good, move on with your day.</p>

<p><strong>"What about eating out?"</strong> You're on a budget. Don't eat out. Cook at home. If you must, order a burger patty or scrambled eggs. Skip the bun and fries.</p>

<h2>The Performance Angle</h2>

<p>I've had clients run this protocol while training 5-6 days a week. Strength goes up. Recovery is solid. Energy stays high. The key? Eat enough. Don't under-eat just because it's cheap.</p>

<p>If you're lifting heavy, bump the ground beef to 2 lbs/day. If you're doing endurance work, add an extra egg or two for quick energy. Adjust based on how you feel, not some arbitrary macro calculator.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li>Carnivore doesn't have to be expensive. Ground beef and eggs get the job done for $7/day.</li>
<li>You're getting 1,700+ calories, 130g+ protein, and complete nutrition without supplements.</li>
<li>Buy in bulk when sales hit. Freeze what you don't use. Your cost drops even lower.</li>
<li>Skip the fancy cuts and grass-fed hype. Regular ground beef and conventional eggs still work.</li>
<li>Adjust portions based on your training and energy needs. More beef if you're active, same base if you're not.</li>
<li>This protocol is sustainable. You can run it for months without issues.</li>
</ul>

<p>Stop overthinking it. Buy ground beef. Buy eggs. Eat them. Save money. Feel better. That's the whole game.</p>
