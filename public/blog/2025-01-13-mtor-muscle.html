Activate it, build muscle. Suppress it, lose muscle.</p><p>Animal protein activates mTOR like nothing else. Beef, eggs, fish trigger protein synthesis. Your muscles literally grow faster on carnivore than any other diet.</p><p>Here's why: leucine content. Animal protein is packed with leucine, the amino acid that directly activates mTOR. Plant protein has leucine but not enough to trigger the same response.</p><h2>The Practical Point</h2><p>On carnivore, you build muscle faster. You recover faster. You get stronger faster. That's not bro science, that's biology.</p><p>Eat meat, lift heavy, get bigger. It's the simplest protocol ever.</p><p>—Marcus</p></body></html>
