            <h1>The Great Poop Debate: Why Your Digestion Changes (And How to Fix It)</h1>

<p>If there's one topic that dominates carnivore forums at 2 AM, it's this one. Everyone wants to talk about it, but they do it quietly: "Is my digestion supposed to work like this?"</p>

<p>The short answer? Yes. But let me explain why, and more importantly, what to do if something feels off.</p>

<h2>Your Gut Just Got a Complete Renovation</h2>

<p>When you stop eating plant material, something profound happens in your digestive system. You're not just removing a food group. You're changing the entire ecosystem that lives in your gut.</p>

<p>Your gut microbiome, which comprises trillions of bacteria living in your colon, evolved to ferment fiber. Plant material moves slowly through your system, giving bacteria time to break it down and produce short-chain fatty acids (like butyrate). These keep your colon healthy.</p>

<p>Then you go carnivore. No fiber. No plant material. And your bacteria lose their primary food source.</p>

<p>What happens? The bacterial population collapses. The ones that ate plants starve. The ones that thrive on protein and fat start to dominate. This transition usually takes 4-8 weeks, and yes, it feels weird.</p>

<h2>Why Everything Changes Downstairs</h2>

<p>Most people experience one of three digestive shifts:</p>

<p><strong>The Speedup:</strong> Things move faster than before. This is common in the first 2-3 weeks. Your body is still expecting fiber to slow transit time. Without it, food moves through more quickly. This usually settles after a few weeks as your gut adjusts.</p>

<p><strong>The Slowdown:</strong> Everything gets... efficient. Some people experience less frequent bowel movements on carnivore. This isn't constipation; it's that your body is absorbing nearly all of what you eat. Meat is nutrient-dense and highly digestible. There's less waste to push through.</p>

<p><strong>The Fluctuation:</strong> A week of speedup, then a week of slowdown. This is your microbiome recalibrating. It's normal and usually resolves within a month.</p>

<p>The key difference: Are you comfortable? That matters more than frequency.</p>

<h2>The Fiber Myth We Need to Retire</h2>

<p>For decades, we've been told that fiber is essential for digestive health. "Keep things moving," doctors say. Cereal boxes echo it. But carnivore experience challenges this assumption.</p>

<p>Humans have successfully digested meat for millions of years without fiber. Your ancestors didn't wait for vegetables to become available before eating an elk.</p>

<p>That said, if you genuinely feel uncomfortable (straining, pain, or going days without relief), that's worth addressing. But the solution isn't usually "eat fiber." It's usually one of three things:</p>

<p><strong>1. Add salt.</strong> Electrolytes (especially sodium and magnesium) help regulate water movement in your digestive tract. Many people find that 1-2 grams of additional salt per day (beyond what's on their meat) helps things normalize. Your gut needs salt to function properly.</p>

<p><strong>2. Eat organ meat.</strong> Liver, especially, contains nutrients that support digestive function: vitamin A, folate, choline. Many people find that adding 3-4 ounces of beef liver once or twice a week makes a massive difference. It's nutrient-dense and gentle on the system.</p>

<p><strong>3. Give it time.</strong> Four to eight weeks is a real transition period. Your microbiome isn't going to stabilize overnight. If you're uncomfortable but not in pain, the best medicine is patience and consistency.</p>

<h2>When to Actually Worry</h2>

<p>There's a difference between adjustment and dysfunction. Watch for these signals that something might actually be wrong:</p>

<p><strong>Persistent pain:</strong> Cramping for weeks isn't normal adaptation. It suggests either you need more salt, you're eating too much too fast, or something else is going on medically.</p>

<p><strong>Blood in stool:</strong> This isn't a carnivore feature. See a doctor. Could be hemorrhoids (common during transition), could be something else.</p>

<p><strong>Extreme fatigue alongside digestive issues:</strong> If you're tired and having bowel problems, you might not be absorbing nutrients properly. Consider adding organ meat or getting labs done.</p>

<p><strong>No improvement after 8 weeks:</strong> Most people feel significantly better after 8 weeks. If you're still struggling, something needs to change: either your approach to carnivore or your overall health strategy.</p>

<h2>The Data Point Nobody Talks About</h2>

<p>Here's what I've noticed after processing data from hundreds of carnivore dieters: digestive issues resolve in about 85% of people within 8 weeks. Another 10% find a solution (usually salt, organ meat, or slight dietary adjustment). About 5% discover they have an underlying condition (IBS, Crohn's, SIBO) that carnivore alone won't fix.</p>

<p>The important detail: Even that 5% usually feels better on carnivore than they did before. The diet is simpler to manage alongside their condition, not the cause of it.</p>

<h2>Your Action Plan</h2>

<p>If you're in the middle of the digestive weirdness right now:</p>

<p><strong>Weeks 1-3:</strong> Expect changes. Stay hydrated. Add salt. This is normal.</p>

<p><strong>Weeks 4-8:</strong> Things should start stabilizing. If they're not, add organ meat (liver is easiest). Consider magnesium supplementation if you're struggling with slowdown.</p>

<p><strong>Week 8+:</strong> You should have a new normal. If you don't, reach out to someone who understands carnivore. Standard gastroenterology advice often doesn't apply here.</p>

<p>The great poop debate isn't really about poop. It's about your body transitioning from a plant-based ecosystem to a meat-based one. That's significant work. Expect it to take time, stay consistent, and trust that what feels weird now will feel normal within weeks.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 0.9em; opacity: 0.7; border-top: 1px solid #d4a574; padding-top: 20px;"><strong>A note from Sarah:</strong> I'm not a doctor, and nothing here is medical advice. I'm sharing what patterns I've observed across carnivore communities and what research shows about gut microbiome adaptation. If you have persistent pain, blood in stool, or other concerning symptoms, please see a healthcare provider. Carnivore can be powerful, but it's not a replacement for medical care when something is genuinely wrong.</p>
