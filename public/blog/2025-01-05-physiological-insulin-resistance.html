    <title>Physiological Insulin Resistance: Understanding Your Fasting Glucose - Sarah</title>

<h1>Physiological Insulin Resistance: Why Your Fasting Glucose Isn't What You Think It Is</h1>

<p>One of the most common panic moments I see in the carnivore community happens around week three.</p>

<p>Someone gets their fasting blood glucose checked. It's higher than it was on a standard diet. They freak out. They think carnivore broke their metabolism or they're developing diabetes.</p>

<p>This is actually normal. And it's not what most people think it is.</p>

<h2>What Physiological Insulin Resistance Actually Is</h2>

<p>Your body is incredibly smart. When you eat very few carbs, your muscles stop storing glucose as their primary fuel. They switch to using fat and ketones instead.</p>

<p>This makes your muscles less sensitive to insulin. Not in a bad way. In an efficient way.</p>

<p>Your brain still needs some glucose. Your liver makes it from protein and glycerol through gluconeogenesis. Your fasting glucose goes up slightly because your body is now manufacturing exactly what it needs instead of relying on dietary carbs.</p>

<p>This is physiological adaptation. Not metabolic breakdown.</p>

<h2>The Difference Between Pathological and Physiological Insulin Resistance</h2>

<p>Real insulin resistance (the dangerous kind) happens when your pancreas has to pump out huge amounts of insulin to move glucose into cells.</p>

<p>Your fasting insulin stays high. Your glucose stays high. Your triglycerides go up. Your inflammation markers rise.</p>

<p>That's bad.</p>

<p>Physiological insulin resistance on carnivore looks different. Your fasting glucose might be 105-115 (slightly elevated). But your fasting insulin is probably low or normal. Your triglycerides drop. Your inflammation markers improve.</p>

<p>Same symptom (higher glucose), completely different cause.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>

<p>Your doctor might see a fasting glucose of 110 and tell you that you're prediabetic.</p>

<p>But if your fasting insulin is 5 (normal range) and your triglycerides are 80 (excellent), you're not actually insulin resistant. You're adapted to a low-carb diet.</p>

<p>This is why looking at the full picture matters. Glucose alone tells you nothing. You need glucose AND insulin AND triglycerides AND inflammation markers.</p>

<h2>How to Verify You're Adapted, Not Broken</h2>

<p>Get a full metabolic panel. Ask for:</p>

<p>Fasting glucose (your baseline)</p>

<p>Fasting insulin (the real indicator of insulin resistance)</p>

<p>Triglycerides (inflammation marker)</p>

<p>HDL cholesterol (should go up on carnivore)</p>

<p>If glucose is slightly elevated but insulin is low, triglycerides are down, and HDL is up, you're adapted and healthy.</p>

<p>If glucose is high AND insulin is high AND triglycerides are high, that's when you have a problem.</p>

<h2>The Honest "Not a Doctor" Part</h2>

<p>I'm not a doctor. But I've watched hundreds of blood work panels from carnivore people. The pattern is consistent. When done right, carnivore improves insulin sensitivity, reduces inflammation, and improves metabolic health.</p>

<p>If your doctor is concerned about one number in isolation, ask for the full picture. Bring your other markers. Talk about your energy, sleep, weight, and how you feel.</p>

<p>Those matter more than one number on a test.</p>

<h2>What Actually Fixes It If Something's Wrong</h2>

<p>If you're truly concerned, the fix is simple: eat more fat, less protein. More salt. More electrolytes. Wait longer. Your body might just need more time to fully adapt.</p>

<p>Most people who have concerning glucose numbers fix it just by optimizing their fat intake and electrolytes.</p>

<p>Give it time. The numbers usually follow.</p>
