Let's squash the biggest myths right now.</div></div><div class="post-content"><h1>10 Carnivore Myths Beginners Believe</h1><p>Every week in the community, people show up with the same worries. They've heard stuff that's just wrong. Let me clear the air on the biggest myths we see.</p><h2>Myth 1: You'll Get Deficiencies Without Vegetables</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "You need vegetables for vitamins. Meat doesn't have everything."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> Beef has vitamin A (retinol, the usable form), B vitamins, iron, zinc, selenium, and more. The only thing you'll be low in is vitamin C—but carnivores rarely get scurvy. Check the wiki for the complete breakdown.</p><p><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This fear keeps people from starting. It's unfounded.</p></div><h2>Myth 2: Your Cholesterol Will Skyrocket and Kill You</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "Eating meat = high cholesterol = heart attack."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> Yes, your cholesterol numbers might change. But cholesterol isn't evil. LDL can go up while your actual risk factors (triglycerides, inflammation, blood sugar) improve dramatically. Read the bloodwork post for what actually matters.</p><p><strong>The science:</strong> Most carnivores show improving health markers even when total cholesterol rises. Your doctor sees the number and panics. You see improved energy, stable weight, and better blood sugar. Who's right?</p></div><h2>Myth 3: You'll Lose All Your Muscle</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "Without carbs, your muscles will waste away."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> Carnivore is literally all protein and fat—the perfect muscle-building diet. Athletes report better recovery, strength gains, and body composition improvements. The carb dependency myth dies fast once you see your own results.</p><p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> If you're strength training, you might actually build muscle faster because stable energy = consistent training.</p></div><h2>Myth 4: Everyone Gets Kidney Disease</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "Too much protein destroys your kidneys."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> This was debunked decades ago. High protein harms kidneys that are already damaged. Healthy kidneys handle meat just fine. There's zero evidence carnivore damages kidneys.</p><p><strong>What actually matters:</strong> Stay hydrated, get enough salt. Your kidneys will be fine.</p></div><h2>Myth 5: It's Too Expensive</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "Carnivore costs too much. I can't afford grass-fed everything."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> Supermarket beef is cheap. Ground beef, chicken thighs, pork shoulder—all affordable. You don't need grass-fed or organic to get results. If budget is tight, conventional meat beats fancy meat that you can't afford consistently.</p><p><strong>Pro move:</strong> Check the budget strategies post for cost hacks (bulk buying, sales, organ meats, whole animals).</p></div><h2>Myth 6: You Have to Eat Perfect Cuts</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "You need premium grass-fed brisket or it won't work."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> People get amazing results on ground beef from the supermarket. Fancy cuts are nice but not necessary. Consistency matters infinitely more than perfection.</p><p><strong>The truth:</strong> The best meat is the meat you can actually afford and eat regularly.</p></div><h2>Myth 7: You Can't Ever Have Cravings Go Away</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "You'll always want pizza and donuts. You're just restricting yourself."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> Most carnivores report cravings disappearing completely by week 2-3. It's not willpower—it's blood sugar stabilization. When your insulin isn't spiking and crashing, the cravings actually vanish.</p><p><strong>What people say:</strong> "I could have pizza now and don't even want it." This isn't restriction. It's actual appetite normalization.</p></div><h2>Myth 8: Carnivore Destroys Your Teeth</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "No carbs means no sugar means bacteria run wild... wait, that doesn't make sense."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> No sugar = no fuel for cavity-causing bacteria. Your teeth are actually healthier on carnivore because there's no sugar for them to feast on. Most people report stable or improved dental health.</p><p><strong>What changes:</strong> Your plaque composition shifts (normal), but cavities? Less likely.</p></div><h2>Myth 9: The "Experts" Say It's Dangerous</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "Doctors and nutritionists say carnivore is dangerous."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> Some do. Some don't. The ones who've actually studied carnivore and tracked their patients see consistent health improvements. The ones speaking from outdated dogma warn against it.</p><p><strong>Key point:</strong> Look at outcomes. Thousands of people are healthier on carnivore. Their numbers improved. Their symptoms resolved. Trust data over blanket warnings.</p></div><h2>Myth 10: You Can't Be Social</h2><div class="myth-box"><p><strong>The myth:</strong> "If I do carnivore, I'll be the weird person at every gathering."</p><p><strong>The reality:</strong> You adapt. You bring your own food. You order steak at restaurants. People ask questions. You answer them or don't. It's a minor adjustment, not a hermit lifestyle.</p><p><strong>The community has solutions:</strong> Check the family integration post for exactly how to navigate this. Spoiler: it's not as hard as you think.</p></div><h2>The Meta Myth: "One Diet Works for Everyone"</h2><p>Actually, carnivore might not be perfect for you. Some people thrive. Some people feel off. That's fine. The point is—try it based on evidence, not myths, and see how you actually respond.</p><p>If you feel amazing, you've got your answer. If it's not working, you tried. No shame either way.</p><h2>What Beginners Should Actually Worry About</h2><p><strong>Real things that matter:</strong></p><ul><li>Eating enough (undereating causes most problems)</li><li>Getting enough salt (your body flushes more on carnivore)</li><li>Staying hydrated</li><li>Finding meat you actually like</li><li>Sticking with it past week 2 when adaptation hits</li></ul><p><strong>Things to ignore:</strong></p><ul><li>Perfect sourcing</li><li>Optimal macros day 1</li><li>What people on the internet think</li><li>Generic warnings from doctors who don't understand the diet</li><li>Your uncle's friend's cousin who "tried it and got sick"</li></ul><h2>The Beginning Reality</h2><p>Most of these myths come from legitimate-sounding sources. Your doctor believes them. Your family believes them. The internet reinforces them. But they don't hold up when you look at actual carnivore communities and track real people's outcomes.</p><p>The best debunk is personal experience. Try carnivore. Track what happens. Trust your own results more than internet myths.</p><p>—Chloe</p></div><div class="post-footer"><div class="tags"><span class="tag">myths</span><span class="tag">misconceptions</span><span class="tag">science</span><span class="tag">beginner-friendly</span></div><div class="resources-section"><h3>Resources & Related Posts</h3><ul><li><a href="2025-12-19-blood-work-markers.html">Bloodwork Markers Post</a> - Understand what your labs actually mean</li><li><a href="2025-12-23-family-integration-hacks.html">Family Integration Strategies</a> - How to navigate social situations</li><li><a href="../../wiki.html#nutrient-density">Wiki: Nutrient Density</a> - Complete nutritional breakdown of carnivore</li><li><a href="../../wiki.html#cholesterol">Wiki: Cholesterol Explained</a> - The full story on lipid panels</li><li><a href="../../calculator.html">Macro Calculator</a> - Track your actual intake and optimize</li></ul></div></div><footer style="margin-top:60px;padding-top:20px;border-top:1px solid #8b4513;text-align:center;color:#d4a574;font-size:12px"><p>&copy; 2025 Carnivore Weekly | <a href="../../about.html" style="color:#d4a574;text-decoration:underline">About</a> | <a href="../../the-lab.html" style="color:#d4a574;text-decoration:underline">The Lab</a> | <a href="mailto:feedback@carnivoreweekly.com" style="color:#d4a574;text-decoration:underline">Contact</a></p><p style="margin-top:10px;font-size:11px">🤖 Curated with AI • Made with <a href="https://claude.com/claude-code" style="color:#d4a574;text-decoration:underline">Claude Code</a></p></footer></div></body></html>
