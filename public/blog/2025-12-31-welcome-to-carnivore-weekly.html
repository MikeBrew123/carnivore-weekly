        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Hi there. I'm Sarah, and I want to tell you what we're building here and why we're excited to have you reading this on day one.</p>

            <p><strong>Carnivore Weekly exists because the carnivore community deserves better curation.</strong></p>

            <h2>Why We Started This</h2>
            <p>The carnivore space has grown rapidly. What once was a small group of people experimenting with an all-meat diet has become a genuine movement with hundreds of thousands asking serious questions about health, metabolism, and what it means to eat in alignment with our biology.</p>

            <p>But here's the problem: signal is drowning in noise.</p>

            <p>If you're new to carnivore, you face an overwhelming amount of content. Some of it is solid. Some of it is hype. Some of it contradicts other pieces. And almost none of it distinguishes between proven physiological adaptation and unsubstantiated claims.</p>

            <h2>What We're Building</h2>
            <p>Carnivore Weekly is your weekly digest of the most important developments in the carnivore space. We curate:</p>

            <ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
                <li><strong>Trending topics</strong> - What's actually being discussed in the community</li>
                <li><strong>Evidence-based analysis</strong> - The science behind the trends</li>
                <li><strong>Protocol optimization</strong> - Practical approaches that work</li>
                <li><strong>Real stories</strong> - From real people with measurable results</li>
                <li><strong>Deeper dives</strong> - Weekly blog posts exploring health mechanisms, blood work interpretation, and condition-specific guidance</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What This Isn't</h2>
            <p>We're not here to sell you supplements. We're not promoting a particular brand or product. We're not pushing ideology. We're focused on one thing: <strong>helping you make better decisions about your health based on evidence and community experience.</strong></p>

            <h2>For New Readers</h2>
            <p>If you're just starting with carnivore, welcome. Our <a href="/wiki.html">Wiki section</a> covers the fundamentals: how to start, what to expect during adaptation, how to structure your meals, and how to track your progress.</p>

            <p>If you have specific health concerns (hormones, digestion, performance, sleep), you'll find <a href="/blog.html">blog posts</a> exploring those topics in depth, with citations and practical approaches.</p>

            <h2>For Experienced Carnivores</h2>
            <p>You probably know carnivore works for you. Our job is to help you understand <em>why</em> it works, how to optimize further, and stay updated on what's emerging in the research and community.</p>

            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
            <p>Every week, we'll be curating the best from the carnivore community, analyzing trends, and publishing deep-dive content on specific topics. We'll be honest about what we know, what we don't know, and where the research is still evolving.</p>

            <p>Thank you for being here on day one. We're building this for you.</p>

            <p><strong>—Sarah</strong></p>
