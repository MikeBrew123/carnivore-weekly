<p>New Year's resolutions have a 92% failure rate. You know this. You've failed at resolutions. Everyone has. The pattern is predictable: make big promise, be excited for two weeks, slip back into old habits, feel bad, forget about it by February.</p>
<div class="tldr-box">
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>92% failure rate</strong> — resolutions fail because they're too vague, rely on willpower, and ignore environment</li>
<li><strong>Identity &gt; behavior</strong> — "I'm someone who eats meat" beats "I'm trying a diet"</li>
<li><strong>Start microscopic</strong> — one carnivore meal per day for 2 weeks, then expand</li>
<li><strong>Environment first</strong> — remove temptation, stock meat, make the right choice the easy choice</li>
<li><strong>Carnivore advantage</strong> — fewer decisions = more consistency = easier habits</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Here's why it happens, and what actually works instead.</p>
<h2>Why Resolutions Fail</h2>
<div class="failure-grid">
<div class="failure-card">
<h4>Too Vague</h4>
<p>"Get healthier" or "change my diet" isn't a resolution. It's a direction without a target. Your brain doesn't execute on vague directions. It executes on specific, small behaviors.</p>
</div>
<div class="failure-card">
<h4>Ignoring Environment</h4>
<p>You can't willpower your way through bad environment design. If your kitchen is full of bread and cookies, you'll eat bread and cookies. Willpower is a myth. Environment is real.</p>
</div>
<div class="failure-card">
<h4>Relying on Motivation</h4>
<p>Motivation is inconsistent. It's a feeling. You're not going to feel motivated on January 17th at 6 PM after a hard day. Habits don't care about motivation. Build the behavior, motivation follows later.</p>
</div>
<div class="failure-card">
<h4>Ignoring Identity</h4>
<p>You're trying to change behavior without changing how you see yourself. If you see yourself as "someone who tries but always fails at diets," then you will. The identity part is the hard part.</p>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
                        "Your brain doesn't execute on vague directions. It executes on specific, small behaviors."
                    </blockquote>
<h2>What Actually Works</h2>
<div class="strategy-grid">
<div class="strategy-card">
<h4>Make It Small</h4>
<p>Not "start carnivore." Start "eat meat for lunch every day for two weeks." That's doable. Two weeks in, it's a habit. Then add another meal. Then optimize. Small stacks into big.</p>
</div>
<div class="strategy-card">
<h4>Change Environment First</h4>
<p>Before willpower, fix your surroundings. If you're eating processed food, it's probably in your house. Remove it. Keep meat in your freezer. Make the right choice the easy choice.</p>
</div>
<div class="strategy-card">
<h4>Track Something Simple</h4>
<p>Not calories. Not macros. Track: "Did I eat carnivore today?" Yes or no. That's it. A streak of yes answers is motivating. It's visible progress that motivates more progress.</p>
</div>
<div class="strategy-card">
<h4>Find Your Real Why</h4>
<p>Not "I should be healthier." That's weak. Is it "I want energy to play with my kids"? "I want to not feel like shit every afternoon"? If your why is strong enough, the how takes care of itself.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="identity-box">
<h4>Build Identity, Not Just Habits</h4>
<div class="identity-compare">
<div class="identity-old">
<span>Temporary</span>
<p>"I'm starting a diet"</p>
</div>
<div class="identity-new">
<span>Identity</span>
<p>"I'm someone who eats meat and feels good"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p style="color: #e8dcc8; margin-top: 20px; line-height: 1.7;">The diet you can quit. The identity you can't, because it's who you are now. Start by doing the behavior. The identity follows. Act like someone who takes their health seriously for 30 days. By day 31, you're not acting anymore.</p>
</div>

<figcaption>Keep it simple. Meat. Done.</figcaption>
</figure>
<div class="advantage-box">
<h4>🥩 The Carnivore-Specific Advantage</h4>
<p>Carnivore is actually the easiest diet to stick to because it's restrictive. No choices about what you're eating. Meat. Done. Fewer decisions means more consistency. Most diets fail because they require constant willpower and decision-making. This one is simple enough that it becomes automatic.</p>
</div>
<div class="formula-box">
<h3>The Real Formula</h3>

<span class="formula-step">Start Small</span>
<span class="formula-plus">+</span>
<span class="formula-step">Fix Environment</span>

<span class="formula-step">Track Visibly</span>
<span class="formula-plus">+</span>
<span class="formula-step">Know Your Why</span>
</div>
<p style="color: #e8dcc8; margin-top: 20px; font-size: 1rem;">That's it. That's the whole formula.</p>
</div>
<h2>Why New Year Matters (And Why It Doesn't)</h2>
<p>The New Year is psychologically powerful. It's a marker. A fresh start. Use that. But understand that January 2nd is no more special than June 15th. The only thing that matters is the next action.</p>
<p>Don't wait for January 1st if you want to start. But if it's December 28th and you want to start on New Year's, fine. Use the psychological momentum. Just don't think January 1st is magic. Consistency is magic. Starting is easy. Staying is hard.</p>
<h2>One Thing That Actually Changes Everything</h2>
<p>Tell someone. Make the commitment public and specific. "I'm going to eat carnivore in January" vs. "I'm going to eat only meat for January, and I'm going to tell you how it goes every week."</p>
<p>Public commitment changes behavior. Not because shame works (it doesn't long-term), but because it makes you take it seriously. You said you would. Now you probably will.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
                        "Most people fail because they're trying to change their whole life with willpower. Change your environment. Change your identity. The willpower part becomes unnecessary."
                    </blockquote>
<h2>The Honest Take</h2>
<p>New Year's resolutions fail because they're designed wrong. If you design them right—small, specific, identity-focused, environmentally supported, publicly committed—they work. Most people fail because they're trying to change their whole life with willpower. Change your environment. Change your identity. The willpower part becomes unnecessary.</p>
<div class="key-takeaways">
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Start microscopic:</strong> One carnivore meal per day for two weeks. That's it. Build from success.</li>
<li><strong>Fix your kitchen first:</strong> Remove the temptations, stock the freezer with meat. Environment beats willpower every time.</li>
<li><strong>Shift your identity:</strong> "I eat meat" is who you are, not what you're trying. Act for 30 days; become by day 31.</li>
<li><strong>Track binary:</strong> Did I eat carnivore today? Yes/No. That's your only metric. Streaks build momentum.</li>
<li><strong>Make it public:</strong> Tell someone specific what you're doing. Weekly check-ins make you take it seriously.</li>
</ol>
