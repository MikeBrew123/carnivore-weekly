                <h2>Week 2 Carnivore: Your Skin Just Got Worse</h2>

<p>You started carnivore for better health. Maybe weight loss. Maybe energy. You didn't expect your face to explode with acne in week 2. But here you are, staring in the mirror, wondering if you made a mistake.</p>

<p>Don't panic. This is normal. It's temporary. And it's actually a sign that your body is detoxing. Let me explain what's happening and when it gets better.</p>

<h2>What's Actually Happening (The Detox Purge)</h2>

<p>When you cut out carbs, sugar, seed oils, and processed foods, your body starts cleaning house. For years, your skin has been managing inflammation from your diet. Now that the inflammatory foods are gone, your body is pushing out the accumulated toxins.</p>

<p>That's the purge. It's not carnivore causing acne. It's carnivore forcing your body to deal with old inflammation that's been sitting under the surface.</p>

<h3>Why Week 2?</h3>

<p>Most people notice skin issues around day 7-14. That's when your body is deep into fat adaptation. Your insulin levels drop, your hormone levels shift, and your skin reacts.</p>

<p>If you had clear skin before carnivore, this might shock you. If you've always struggled with acne, it might feel like things are getting worse. Either way, it's part of the process.</p>

<h2>The Science Behind It</h2>

<p>Here's what's going on under the hood:</p>

<h3>Hormonal Shifts</h3>

<p>When you cut carbs, your body's hormone balance changes. Insulin drops. Testosterone might spike temporarily in women. Estrogen levels shift. These changes affect your <a href="/wiki/#skin" class="wiki-link">skin's oil production</a>.</p>

<p>More oil means more clogged pores. More breakouts. This stabilizes after a few weeks, but in the short term, it's messy.</p>

<h3>Sebum Production Changes</h3>

<p>Carnivore increases fat intake. Your body responds by producing more sebum (skin oil). If your pores aren't used to this, they clog. Cue the breakouts.</p>

<p>This is temporary. Once your body adjusts to the higher fat intake, sebum production normalizes.</p>

<h3>Detox Pathways</h3>

<p>Your liver and kidneys are your main detox organs. But when they're overwhelmed, your skin steps in as a backup. Your skin is your body's largest organ, and it can excrete toxins through sweat and oil.</p>

<p>Week 2-3 carnivore is when your liver is working overtime. Your skin helps out. That's why you might see more breakouts, oiliness, or even rashes.</p>

<h2>What It Looks Like</h2>

<p>Not everyone's purge looks the same. Here's what people report:</p>

<h3>Cystic Acne</h3>

<p>Deep, painful bumps under the skin. Usually on the jawline, chin, or forehead. These are the worst because they take longer to heal.</p>

<h3>Small Whiteheads</h3>

<p>Little bumps that pop up overnight. These are annoying but they clear faster than cystic acne.</p>

<h3>Oily Skin</h3>

<p>Your face feels greasy all day. You're blotting with tissue constantly. This usually accompanies the breakouts.</p>

<h3>Dry, Flaky Patches</h3>

<p>Some people get dry skin instead of oily. Or both at the same time (combination skin). It's confusing and frustrating.</p>

<h2>How Long Does It Last?</h2>

<p>Most people see the worst of it in week 2-3. By week 4-6, things start clearing up. By week 8-12, most people report the clearest skin they've had in years.</p>

<p>But there's variation. Some people clear up in 3 weeks. Others take 8-10 weeks. If you've had chronic acne for years, expect the purge to last longer.</p>

<p>The key is patience. Don't quit in week 2 because your skin looks bad. That's exactly when you need to push through.</p>

<h2>What Helps (And What Doesn't)</h2>

<h3>What Helps</h3>

<p><strong>Salt your food heavily.</strong> <a href="/wiki/#electrolytes" class="wiki-link">Electrolytes</a> help your body detox faster. When you're flushing out toxins, you need salt to support kidney function.</p>

<p><strong>Drink enough water.</strong> Not too much, but enough. Dehydration slows detox. Water helps your kidneys process waste.</p>

<p><strong>Don't touch your face.</strong> Picking at acne makes it worse. Let it run its course.</p>

<p><strong>Use simple skincare.</strong> Cleanser and moisturizer. That's it. Don't add a bunch of products. Your skin is already stressed.</p>

<p><strong>Give it time.</strong> Seriously. Week 6 will look completely different than week 2.</p>

<h3>What Doesn't Help</h3>

<p><strong>Adding back carbs.</strong> Some people panic and reintroduce carbs thinking it'll fix their skin. It won't. It'll just restart the adaptation process.</p>

<p><strong>Cutting out fat.</strong> Fat isn't causing your acne. Your body adjusting to fat is causing it. Cutting fat will make you feel terrible and won't fix your skin.</p>

<p><strong>Overloading on supplements.</strong> People try zinc, vitamin A, omega-3s, thinking it'll speed up clearing. It might help long-term, but in week 2-3, your body is already overwhelmed. Keep it simple.</p>

<p><strong>Harsh acne treatments.</strong> Benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid, retinoids. These dry out your skin and make the purge worse. Save the heavy artillery for later if you still need it.</p>

<h2>The Week-by-Week Timeline</h2>

<h3>Week 1</h3>

<p>Skin feels normal. Maybe a little dry. No major changes yet.</p>

<h3>Week 2-3</h3>

<p>The purge hits. Breakouts, oiliness, possibly cystic acne. This is the worst phase.</p>

<h3>Week 4-5</h3>

<p>Things start calming down. Breakouts are less frequent. Oiliness decreases.</p>

<h3>Week 6-8</h3>

<p>Skin is noticeably clearer. Breakouts are rare. Oil production normalizes.</p>

<h3>Week 12+</h3>

<p>Most people report the clearest skin of their lives. Acne is gone. Skin tone is even. Redness fades.</p>

<p>This timeline isn't universal, but it's common. If you're still breaking out at week 12, there might be another factor (dairy, eggs, stress). But for most people, the purge is over by then.</p>

<h2>When to Worry</h2>

<p>If your acne is painful, spreading, or accompanied by fever, see a doctor. That's not a purge. That's an infection or allergic reaction.</p>

<p>If you're breaking out in hives or developing a rash all over your body, that's also not normal. Stop carnivore and talk to a doctor.</p>

<p>But if it's just regular acne that showed up in week 2 and isn't infected, you're fine. It's the purge. Wait it out.</p>

<h2>The Payoff: Week 6 and Beyond</h2>

<p>Here's why it's worth pushing through: the skin results after adaptation are insane.</p>

<p>People report:
- No more breakouts (or very rare)
- Even skin tone
- Less redness and inflammation
- Smaller pores
- Healthier glow
- Scars fading faster</p>

<p>I've seen people who struggled with acne for 10+ years completely clear up on carnivore. But they all went through the purge first.</p>

<p>The people who quit in week 2 never get to see this. They think carnivore made their skin worse. But really, they quit right before it got better.</p>

<h2>Managing the Mental Game</h2>

<p>Week 2-3 is hard emotionally. Your face is breaking out. You might be tired from adaptation. You're wondering if this diet is worth it.</p>

<p>Here's what helps:
- Take progress photos. You'll want to see the before-and-after.
- Join a carnivore community. Talk to people who've been through it.
- Remind yourself it's temporary. Most purges last 2-4 weeks max.
- Focus on other wins. Energy, mood, <a href="/wiki/#digestion" class="wiki-link">digestion</a>. Your skin isn't the only thing changing.</p>

<p>Don't let week 2 acne derail you. Week 6 is coming.</p>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Week 2 acne is a detox purge, not a diet failure.</strong> Your body is cleaning out old inflammation.</li>
<li><strong>It gets worse before it gets better.</strong> Week 2-3 is the peak. Week 6+ is when skin clears.</li>
<li><strong>Don't add back carbs or cut fat.</strong> That'll restart adaptation and prolong the purge.</li>
<li><strong>Keep skincare simple.</strong> Cleanser and moisturizer. Don't overdo it.</li>
<li><strong>Most people have clear skin by week 8-12.</strong> The payoff is worth the temporary breakouts.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're in week 2 and your face is a mess, you're right on track. Don't quit now. The best skin of your life is a few weeks away.</p>
