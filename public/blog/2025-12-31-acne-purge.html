        <!-- Post Content -->
        <div class="post-content">

<p>You start carnivore. For the first 3-7 days, everything is amazing. Clear energy, no hunger, mental focus is sharp. Then, around day 5-7, you break out.</p>

<p>Acne that you haven't had in years, or acne worse than usual. Your first instinct: carnivore is making me break out. You might quit.</p>

<p>Wait. This is usually the opposite of what's happening. This is detox purging, and it's a sign your body is cleaning house.</p>

<h2>What Is the Acne Purge?</h2>

<p>When you drastically change your diet, your body ramps up detoxification. Your liver is working harder. Your skin is eliminating toxins. Your hormones are rebalancing. This all happens at once, and it comes out through your skin.</p>

<p>The acne isn't carnivore causing breakouts. It's your body eliminating toxins that your skin has been storing.</p>

<h3>The Mechanism</h3>

<p>Your skin is an elimination organ. When your internal systems are detoxifying (liver processing, hormones shifting), the skin pitches in by releasing stuff. Oils, histamines, hormonal byproducts. All of this tries to come out, and if it gets trapped in a pore, you get a pimple.</p>

<p>It's uncomfortable, but it's not harmful. It's progress.</p>

<h2>How Long It Lasts</h2>

<p>Usually 2-4 weeks. Sometimes up to 6 weeks if you had a lot of toxin buildup. By week 4-6, most people have clearer skin than before they started.</p>

<p>The timeline is: breakout weeks 1-3, gradually improving weeks 3-6, clear by week 6-8.</p>

<h3>Intensity Varies</h3>

<p>If you had a lot of processed food in your system before carnivore, the purge is more intense. If you were already fairly clean, it's milder. Heavy sugar and seed oil diet? Expect a bigger purge. Already eating reasonably well? Smaller purge.</p>

<h2>Why It's Actually a Good Sign</h2>

<p>The purge means your body is responding to the diet change. Your detoxification systems are working. Your hormones are rebalancing (rebalancing always causes temporary disruption).</p>

<p>If you didn't break out, your body might be responding less. Some people don't purge, which is fine. But if you do, it's evidence that something is shifting internally.</p>

<p>After the purge clears, skin is usually better than before. Clearer, less oily, fewer blackheads. This is the payoff.</p>

<h2>What Not to Do</h2>

<p>Don't change anything else while purging. Don't add expensive skincare. Don't add supplements hoping to help. You'll confuse the data. Just eat carnivore, let it purge, and see where you are after 6 weeks.</p>

<p>Don't quit because of the purge. The acne is temporary. The benefits (clear skin, good energy, good digestion) are permanent. The purge is the transition. Push through.</p>

<h3>What You CAN Do</h3>

<p>Keep your skin clean. Wash your face with plain water or gentle cleanser. Don't aggressively exfoliate (your skin is already doing enough). Avoid touching your face.</p>

<p>Drink more water. The skin purging is trying to eliminate stuff; supporting your kidneys and liver helps this process. Water is cheap and effective.</p>

<p>If you're really uncomfortable, salt baths can help. Salt has anti-inflammatory properties and supports skin health. Soak for 20 minutes. It helps.</p>

<h2>Individual Variation</h2>

<p>Some people purge on day 2. Some on day 7. Some don't purge at all. Some purge for 2 weeks, some for 8 weeks. Your baseline skin health, previous diet, overall toxin load, hormonal balance, all matter.</p>

<p>If you don't purge, you might have had cleaner starting point or your body is eliminating differently. Both are fine.</p>

<h2>After the Purge</h2>

<p>Most people end up with better skin than before they started. Fewer pimples, less oiliness, smaller pores, better complexion overall.</p>

<p>This usually stabilizes by week 8-12. After that, if you stay on carnivore, skin continues to improve. The acne doesn't come back.</p>

<h2>The Reframe</h2>

<p>The acne purge is uncomfortable, but it's not failure. It's not carnivore making you break out. It's your body detoxifying and rebalancing. It's progress. It's temporary. And on the other side of it is usually the clearest skin you've had in years.</p>

<h2>The Practical Take</h2>

<p>If you break out when you start carnivore, it's probably the purge. Give it 4 weeks minimum before judging. Keep skin clean, hydrate, and wait. By week 6-8, skin clarity returns and usually improves. The purge is a feature, not a bug. It means your body is working correctly.</p>
