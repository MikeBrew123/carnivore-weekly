Sometimes it's metabolic.</p><p>When your blood sugar swings wildly (carbs spike, insulin crashes), your dopamine and cortisol follow the same pattern. Up. Down. Scattered. Foggy. Can't focus.</p><p>Carnivore stabilizes blood sugar completely. No spikes. No crashes. Constant, steady energy source from fat and ketones.</p><p>Your brain runs better on ketones than glucose anyway. Ketones are a cleaner fuel. More stable energy production. Less oxidative stress.</p><h2>What People Report</h2><p>Better focus. Sustained attention. No mid-afternoon crash. Ability to work for 4-6 hours without breaking concentration.</p><p>Some people find they no longer "need" their ADHD meds. Some reduce their dose. Some stay on meds but feel clearer with carnivore as the foundation.</p><h2>The Mechanism</h2><p>Blood sugar stability = dopamine stability = focus and motivation.</p><p>Add in the reduced inflammation from cutting processed food, and your brain literally functions better.</p><p>Not a cure. But a massive improvement in baseline function.</p><p>—Sarah</p></body></html>
