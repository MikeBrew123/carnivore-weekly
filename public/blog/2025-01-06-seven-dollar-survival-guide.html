You still want carnivore results. Here's the math.</p><p>Ground beef: $3-4 per pound. Eggs: $0.20 each. That's your whole protocol. Three pounds of ground beef per day costs $9-12. Three dozen eggs costs $9. Split it: 1.5 pounds ground beef, 18 eggs, you're at $7.</p><p>That's breakfast, lunch, dinner, with calories to spare.</p><h2>The 80/20 Fat Split</h2><p>Ground beef (80/20) is your anchor. Cook a pound. Eat half at breakfast with four eggs, half at lunch. Dinner is six scrambled eggs in the fat from the ground beef. That's 2000+ calories, solid macros, done.</p><p>Repeat daily. Your cost per day stays under $7. Your results don't suffer.</p><h2>Scaling Up</h2><p>If you can stretch to $10/day, add a third pound of ground beef. If you're at $15/day, rotate in fattier cuts when they go on sale. Bulk buying works: cheaper per pound.</p><p>The point: carnivore doesn't require money. It requires consistency and math.</p><p>—Marcus</p></body></html>
