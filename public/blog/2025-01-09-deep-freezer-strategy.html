Yields 150-180 pounds of meat. That's $5-8 per pound all-in.</p><p>Grocery store beef: $10-16 per pound for quality cuts.</p><p>Over a year, one half-cow saves you $1200-2000 versus grocery shopping.</p><h2>The Real Win</h2><p>It's not just cost. It's consistency. You never run out. You always have meat. Your diet never breaks because you're stuck at a grocery store with no beef in stock.</p><p>Plus, farm beef is better. Higher omega-3s, more nutrients, and you know the source.</p><h2>The Setup</h2><p>Split a half-cow with someone. Get a chest freezer ($300, lasts 10 years). Stock up. Done.</p><p>This is the play for long-term carnivore. Not price gouging at Whole Foods every week.</p><p>—Marcus</p></body></html>
