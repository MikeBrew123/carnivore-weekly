                <p>Your period stopped. Or it became erratic. Or it's heavier than ever. You went carnivore to fix your health, and now your cycle is a mess.</p>

<p>Your doctor says you need birth control to "regulate" your hormones. Reddit says you're doing carnivore wrong. Everyone's got an opinion, but nobody has answers.</p>

<p>Here's what's actually happening, what's normal, and when you should worry.</p>

<p><strong>NOT A DOCTOR DISCLAIMER</strong>: I'm a health coach and researcher, not a physician. This isn't medical advice. Always consult your doctor for hormonal health concerns.</p>

<h2>Why Your Period Changed on Carnivore</h2>

<p>When you switch to carnivore, your hormones don't stay the same. That's the whole point. You're reversing insulin resistance, reducing inflammation, and changing your body composition. All of that affects your menstrual cycle.</p>

<p>Here are the most common changes women report:</p>

<strong>1. Period Stops (Amenorrhea)</strong>

<p>This happens in two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women coming from restrictive eating or over-exercising (hypothalamic amenorrhea)</li>
<li>Women losing significant weight rapidly (temporary disruption)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you had irregular periods before carnivore (PCOS, hypothalamic amenorrhea), your cycle might disappear for 3-6 months as your body recalibrates. This is often a healing response, not a problem.</p>

<strong>2. Period Becomes Regular</strong>

<p>For women with PCOS, endometriosis, or irregular cycles, carnivore often restores normal ovulation within 3-6 months. Cycles that were 40-60 days long shorten to 28-32 days. This is a sign your hormones are balancing.</p>

<strong>3. Period Becomes Heavier</strong>

<p>Some women experience heavier periods initially (months 1-3) as estrogen detoxification ramps up. This usually resolves by month 4-6 once your <a href="/wiki/#organ-meats" class="wiki-link">liver</a> catches up with hormone metabolism.</p>

<strong>4. Period Becomes Lighter</strong>

<p>Endometriosis and adenomyosis often improve on carnivore, leading to lighter, less painful periods. This is a good sign.</p>

<strong>5. PMS Disappears</strong>

<p>Mood swings, cramps, bloating, and breast tenderness often resolve completely within 2-3 cycles. This is one of the most consistent benefits women report.</p>

<h2>The Hormonal Shift: What's Happening Biochemically</h2>

<p>Carnivore changes your hormones in predictable ways:</p>

<strong>Insulin Drops</strong>

<p>High insulin (from carbs and frequent eating) drives androgen production in the ovaries. This is the root cause of PCOS. When insulin drops on carnivore, testosterone and DHEA levels normalize, allowing ovulation to resume.</p>

<strong>Inflammation Reduces</strong>

<p>Chronic inflammation disrupts the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, causing irregular cycles. Removing inflammatory foods (grains, seed oils, processed foods) allows the HPO axis to function normally.</p>

<strong>Body Fat Changes</strong>

<p>Fat cells produce estrogen. If you're losing weight on carnivore, you're losing estrogen-producing tissue. This can temporarily disrupt your cycle until your body adjusts to the new baseline.</p>

<p>Conversely, if you're underweight and gaining healthy weight on carnivore, rising estrogen can restart a previously absent period.</p>

<strong>Cortisol Normalizes</strong>

<p>Chronic stress and blood sugar swings spike cortisol, which suppresses progesterone production. Stable blood sugar on carnivore lowers cortisol, allowing progesterone to rise. This improves luteal phase quality and reduces PMS.</p>

<h2>PCOS: The Condition Carnivore Was Made For</h2>

<p>If you have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome), carnivore is arguably the most effective dietary intervention available.</p>

<p>PCOS is fundamentally a disease of insulin resistance. High insulin drives:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ovarian androgen production (testosterone, DHEA)</li>
<li>Irregular ovulation or anovulation</li>
<li>Cystic ovaries</li>
<li>Weight gain, acne, hirsutism</li>
</ul>

<p>Carnivore reverses this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eliminating all carbs, crashing insulin</li>
<li>Reducing inflammation</li>
<li>Improving insulin sensitivity</li>
</ul>

<strong>Typical PCOS response to carnivore:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Month 1-2: Acne starts clearing, energy improves</li>
<li>Month 3-4: First ovulation detected (if you're tracking)</li>
<li>Month 4-6: Regular cycles return</li>
<li>Month 6-12: Labs normalize (testosterone, DHEA, LH/FSH ratio)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Research</strong>: While there are no large RCTs on carnivore for PCOS, <a href="/wiki/#cholesterol" class="wiki-link">ketogenic</a> diets (which carnivore mimics) have been studied extensively. A 2020 meta-analysis found low-carb diets significantly improved:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fasting insulin</li>
<li>Testosterone levels</li>
<li>LH/FSH ratio</li>
<li>Ovulation frequency</li>
</ul>

<p>Carnivore takes this further by eliminating all plant anti-nutrients and inflammatory foods.</p>

<h2>When Your Period Stops: Is It a Problem?</h2>

<p>Losing your period on carnivore can mean different things depending on your history:</p>

<strong>Scenario 1: You Had Hypothalamic Amenorrhea Before Carnivore</strong>

<p>If your period was already absent due to under-eating, over-exercising, or stress, carnivore won't instantly fix it. You need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eat enough (aim for 2000+ calories, track for a month)</li>
<li>Include fat (don't lean-only carnivore)</li>
<li>Reduce exercise intensity</li>
<li>Sleep 8+ hours</li>
<li>Manage stress</li>
</ul>

<p>Your body needs to feel safe before it restarts ovulation. This can take 6-12 months.</p>

<strong>Scenario 2: You're Losing Weight Rapidly</strong>

<p>If you're dropping 2+ pounds per week, your period might pause temporarily. This is a stress response. Your body prioritizes survival over reproduction when it detects rapid energy deficit.</p>

<p>Solution: Slow your weight loss. Eat more fat. Add back calories until you're losing 0.5-1 pound per week. Your period should return within 1-3 cycles.</p>

<strong>Scenario 3: You're Naturally Lean and Always Had Light Periods</strong>

<p>Some women are naturally lean (BMI 18-20) and have minimal body fat. If your periods were always light or irregular even before carnivore, your cycle might remain irregular. This isn't necessarily pathological if you feel good, have energy, and your labs are normal.</p>

<strong>When to Worry:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Period absent > 6 months on carnivore</li>
<li>Other symptoms: fatigue, cold intolerance, hair loss, low libido</li>
<li>Labs show low estrogen, low progesterone, high cortisol</li>
</ul>

<p>Get bloodwork: FSH, LH, estradiol, progesterone (day 21 of cycle if cycling), thyroid panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4), cortisol.</p>

<h2>Heavy Periods: When They're Healing and When They're Not</h2>

<p>Some women experience heavier periods for the first 2-4 cycles on carnivore. This is usually estrogen detoxification.</p>

<p>Your <a href="/wiki/#organ-meats" class="wiki-link">liver</a> metabolizes estrogen into metabolites that are excreted. If you've been eating a high-carb, inflammatory diet for years, your <a href="/wiki/#organ-meats" class="wiki-link">liver</a>'s detox pathways are sluggish. When you go carnivore, estrogen clearance ramps up, and you might shed excess estrogen through heavier bleeding initially.</p>

<p>This should resolve by month 4-6.</p>

<strong>When heavy periods are a problem:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Soaking through a tampon/pad every 1-2 hours</li>
<li>Passing large clots (bigger than a quarter)</li>
<li>Bleeding lasting > 7 days</li>
<li>Fatigue, dizziness, or anemia symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>If this persists beyond month 6, get evaluated for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fibroids</li>
<li>Adenomyosis</li>
<li>Endometrial hyperplasia</li>
<li>Iron deficiency anemia</li>
</ul>

<h2>PMS: Why It Disappears on Carnivore</h2>

<p>PMS (premenstrual syndrome) is driven by blood sugar swings, inflammation, and hormonal imbalance. Carnivore eliminates all three.</p>

<p><strong>Mood swings, irritability, anxiety</strong>: Caused by blood sugar crashes and cortisol spikes. Carnivore stabilizes blood sugar, eliminating the trigger.</p>

<p><strong>Bloating</strong>: Caused by high-carb foods that promote water retention and <a href="/wiki/#digestion" class="wiki-link">gut</a> inflammation. Carnivore eliminates both.</p>

<p><strong>Breast tenderness</strong>: Often linked to high estrogen relative to progesterone. Carnivore balances estrogen and raises progesterone by lowering cortisol.</p>

<p><strong>Cramps</strong>: Driven by prostaglandins, which are produced in response to inflammation. Carnivore dramatically reduces systemic inflammation, reducing prostaglandin production.</p>

<p>Most women report PMS resolving within 2-3 cycles on carnivore. This is one of the most consistent benefits.</p>

<h2>Tracking Your Cycle: Know What's Normal for You</h2>

<p>If you're carnivore and your cycle changes, track it. Use an app like Clue, Flo, or a simple spreadsheet.</p>

<strong>Track:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cycle length (first day of bleeding to first day of next bleed)</li>
<li>Bleeding days (how many days you bleed)</li>
<li>Flow intensity (light, moderate, heavy)</li>
<li>PMS symptoms</li>
<li>Energy levels</li>
<li>Ovulation signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Normal cycle markers:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Cycle length: 25-35 days</li>
<li>Bleeding days: 3-7 days</li>
<li>Ovulation: Day 12-16 (in a 28-day cycle)</li>
<li>Luteal phase (ovulation to period): 12-14 days</li>
</ul>

<p>If your luteal phase is < 10 days, you likely have low progesterone (get bloodwork).</p>

<h2>Should You Supplement?</h2>

<p>Most women don't need supplements on carnivore for hormonal health. Red meat provides everything you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iron (heme iron, highly bioavailable)</li>
<li>B12 (for energy and mood)</li>
<li>Zinc (supports progesterone production)</li>
<li>Selenium (thyroid health)</li>
<li>Choline (liver detoxification)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Exceptions:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Magnesium: If you have cramps or insomnia, supplement 300-400 mg magnesium glycinate.</li>
<li>Vitamin D: If your levels are low (< 30 ng/mL), supplement 2000-5000 IU daily and retest.</li>
<li>Electrolytes: Add salt to food. Low sodium can worsen PMS symptoms.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't supplement estrogen, progesterone, or DHEA without bloodwork and medical supervision.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Your period changing on carnivore is expected. It's a sign your hormones are recalibrating.</p>

<strong>Normal changes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Irregular cycles for 3-6 months as hormones adjust</li>
<li>Heavier periods initially (estrogen detox)</li>
<li>PMS disappearing</li>
<li>Cycle becoming regular if you had PCOS</li>
</ul>

<strong>Red flags:</strong>
<ul>
<li>No period for > 6 months with no prior history of amenorrhea</li>
<li>Extremely heavy bleeding (soaking pads hourly)</li>
<li>Severe fatigue, hair loss, or other thyroid symptoms</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're experiencing red flags, get bloodwork. Otherwise, give your body time. Hormonal healing takes months, not weeks.</p>

<p>And when your cycle regulates, your PMS vanishes, and you feel like a human again, you'll understand why so many women swear by carnivore for hormonal health.</p>
