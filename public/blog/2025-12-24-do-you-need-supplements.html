                The honest answer: it depends. Sarah breaks down what you actually need and what's just marketing noise.

            <h1>Do You Actually Need Supplements on Carnivore?</h1>

<p>There's a subset of the carnivore community that sells supplements. They'll tell you that you need their electrolyte mix, their organ blend, their vitamin stack. And yes, supplements can help.</p>

<p>But do you need them? Honestly? No. Most people don't.</p>

<p>Let me break down what you actually need, what's optional, and what's pure marketing.</p>

<h2>What You Probably Don't Need</h2>

<div class="supp-box">
<p><strong>Multivitamins:</strong> Carnivore is nutrient-dense. If you're eating organ meat even once weekly, you're covered on most micronutrients. Beef liver alone has more vitamin A, B vitamins, and iron than any multivitamin.</p>

<p><strong>Protein powders:</strong> You're eating meat. You have protein. Unless you're a competitive athlete needing post-workout shake, you don't need powder.</p>

<p><strong>Fat-soluble vitamin supplements:</strong> Meat has vitamin D, K2, E. Organs have them concentrated. You're covered without supplementing.</p>

<p><strong>Most herbs and adaptogens:</strong> Mushrooms, medicinal herbs, whatever's trendy. They might help at the margins, but they're not essential. Marketing mostly.</p>
</div>

<h2>What You Might Actually Need (Context-Dependent)</h2>

<h3>Salt</h3>

<p>Not a supplement—it's seasoning. But you need MORE on carnivore than you think. At least 1 teaspoon daily, often more if you're active or in cold climate. This solves 80% of "I feel tired" problems.</p>

<h3>Electrolytes (In Specific Scenarios)</h3>

<p><strong>You might need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy exercise during adaptation (first 4 weeks)</li>
<li>Very hot climate and sweating a lot</li>
<li>Leg cramps that persist despite adequate salt</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to address it:</strong> Salt food heavily first. Drink water with salt added. Then, if still needed, electrolyte supplementation (LMNT, True Salt, etc.) can help.</p>

<p><strong>You probably don't need:</strong> Daily electrolyte supplements if you're sedentary, in moderate climate, and salting your food adequately.</p>

<h3>Organ Meat If You Can't Source It</h3>

<p>Organ meats are the most nutrient-dense food available. If you can get them, get them 1-2x weekly. If you can't access liver or kidney, an organ supplement (like Heart + Soil) can fill gaps.</p>

<p>But this is nice-to-have, not essential. Muscle meat alone sustains people fine.</p>

<h2>When Supplementation Actually Makes Sense</h2>

<p><strong>Scenario 1: You have pre-existing deficiencies.</strong> If you came into carnivore with vitamin D deficiency or anemia, supplementing makes sense while your diet corrects it.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: You have specific health conditions.</strong> Thyroid issues might benefit from iodine. Certain autoimmune conditions might benefit from specific micronutrients. Work with a practitioner on this.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 3: You're an athlete with high demands.</strong> Electrolytes, maybe additional micronutrients, might help during heavy training. But this is optimization, not necessity.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 4: You're testing for nutritional deficiency.</strong> Get blood work. If something's actually low, supplement it. Don't guess.</p>

<h2>The Salt Question (Most Important)</h2>

<p>Carnivore flushes sodium and potassium faster than carb diets. This is biology, not opinion. When people feel tired, weak, or get cramps in weeks 2-3, it's usually salt.</p>

<p>Solution: salt your food generously. That's it. You don't need special electrolyte mixes if salt solves it.</p>

<p><strong>How much salt?</strong> Aim for 1-2 teaspoons daily minimum. More if you're active or hot. Your body will tell you if you have enough (you'll feel good). If you're tired and weak, add salt.</p>

<h2>The Organ Meat Question</h2>

<p>Organ meats hit a different nutrient profile than muscle meat. If you can source them, eat them 1-2x weekly. If you can't:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your health won't suffer without them</li>
<li>But you'll optimize faster if you include them</li>
<li>If supplementing is easier, organ blends work</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't feel pressured to supplement organs if you can eat the real thing. Real food beats supplement every time.</p>

<h2>The Business Reality</h2>

<p>Supplement companies have financial incentive to make you think you need their products. This creates bias in marketing. Take supplement recommendations with that in mind.</p>

<p>Evaluate based on: Do I have actual evidence I'm deficient? Will this supplement address the actual problem? Or am I buying marketing?</p>

<h2>My Honest Framework</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Salt adequately.</strong> Non-negotiable. Solve salt first.</li>
<li><strong>Eat organ meat if accessible.</strong> Once weekly minimum, twice weekly ideal.</li>
<li><strong>Get bloodwork if concerned.</strong> Testing beats guessing.</li>
<li><strong>Supplement only if deficient.</strong> Not "just in case."</li>
<li><strong>Re-test in 3 months.</strong> See if supplementing actually helped.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Most people don't need supplements on carnivore. Salt your food. Eat organ meat if possible. Eat adequate muscle meat. That's sufficient for most people.</p>

<p>If you have specific health issues, pre-existing deficiencies, or are an athlete, supplementation makes sense. But the baseline? You're fine without it.</p>

<p>Don't buy supplements out of fear. Buy them because you've identified actual need.</p>
