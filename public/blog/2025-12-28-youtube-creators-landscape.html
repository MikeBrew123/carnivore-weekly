            <h1>The YouTube Creator Landscape: Who's Teaching Carnivore in 2026</h1>

<p>If you're new to carnivore, YouTube is where you'll probably end up. The community lives there. And the creators shaping the narrative right now are different than they were two years ago.</p>

<p>Let me map the landscape for you. Who's worth following. What they teach. What their blind spots are. What's actually happening in the creator space in 2026.</p>

<h2>The Tier 1 Creators (Reaching Hundreds of Thousands)</h2>

<div class="creator-profile">
<strong>Dr. Shawn Baker</strong>
<div class="creator-stats">~240K subscribers • Daily uploads • Science-focused</div>
<p><strong>What he does:</strong> Research breakdowns, guest interviews, data-driven content. Shawn talks about studies, methods, what works and what doesn't. Very accessible for someone new who wants to understand the science.</p>

<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Credibility. He's an actual doctor. He's balanced—doesn't oversell carnivore. Discusses limitations and safety genuinely.</p>

<p><strong>Blind spot:</strong> Can be dense for absolute beginners. Heavy on data, light on practical "here's what your first week looks like" content.</p>

<p><strong>When to watch:</strong> You want to understand the research. You're skeptical and need credible voice.</p>
</div>

<div class="creator-profile">
<strong>Paul Saladino, MD</strong>
<div class="creator-stats">~180K subscribers • 2-3x weekly uploads • Raw carnivore specialist</div>
<p><strong>What he does:</strong> Extreme carnivore advocacy. Raw meat, nose-to-tail, philosophical framing. Paul positions carnivore as ancestral optimal eating.</p>

<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Passionate. Authentic. Very engaged community. He lives what he teaches.</p>

<p><strong>Blind spot:</strong> Polarizing. Makes claims beyond what research supports. Community is very devoted but also very defensive—less room for nuance.</p>

<p><strong>When to watch:</strong> You're already sold on carnivore and want deep philosophy and raw meat specifics. Fair warning: this community can be intense.</p>
</div>

<div class="creator-profile">
<strong>Ken Berry</strong>
<div class="creator-stats">~150K subscribers • 1-2x weekly uploads • Bridge-builder</div>
<p><strong>What he does:</strong> Practical low-carb/carnivore content. Ken is the keto-to-carnivore bridge. He talks macros, meal prep, family life on this diet, how to handle skeptics.</p>

<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Accessibility. Ken is relatable. He doesn't sound like a guru. He sounds like someone who's been doing this and knows the actual obstacles.</p>

<p><strong>Blind spot:</strong> Can be slightly more "sales-y" than the pure research creators. Some people feel his content is slightly commercial in tone.</p>

<p><strong>When to watch:</strong> You want practical, approachable guidance. You care about how to actually implement this with family and social obligations.</p>
</div>

<h2>The Rising Tier 2 (50-100K Subscribers, Growing Fast)</h2>

<div class="creator-profile">
<strong>Rina Ahluwalia</strong>
<div class="creator-stats">~85K subscribers • Long-form interviews • Credibility focus</div>
<p><strong>What she does:</strong> 60-90 minute interviews with researchers, doctors, and practitioners. Deep conversations that take time to develop ideas.</p>

<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Depth. You get full context and nuance. Rina asks good questions and lets people really explain their thinking.</p>

<p><strong>Blind spot:</strong> Time investment. Not quick learning. For people who want shorter, punchier content, these can feel slow.</p>

<p><strong>When to watch:</strong> You want deep understanding and don't mind long-form. You're past beginner stage.</p>
</div>

<div class="creator-profile">
<strong>Steak and Butter Gal</strong>
<div class="creator-stats">~45K subscribers • Lifestyle/practical focus • Female perspective</div>
<p><strong>What she does:</strong> Day-in-the-life, meal prep, family living, female-specific content. Very relatable personal journey.</p>

<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Real. Grounded. Great for women seeing someone actually living this without making it seem extreme.</p>

<p><strong>Blind spot:</strong> Less on science, more on lifestyle. If you want research backing, look elsewhere first.</p>

<p><strong>When to watch:</strong> You're female, want practical guidance, and like seeing real implementation.</p>
</div>

<h2>The Emerging Trend: Institutional Legitimacy</h2>

<p>This is the big shift I'm seeing. Carnivore is moving from fringe to established enough that legitimate institutions and events are forming.</p>

<p><strong>Meatstock x The Primal 2026</strong> is the first major carnivore convention. Dr. Baker and Paul Saladino announced it. This is huge. Conventions signal mainstream acceptance and institutional development. We're not in the Wild West anymore.</p>

<p>What this means: More research is coming. More mainstream coverage. More mainstream skepticism too. The narrative is solidifying.</p>

<h2>Emerging Creator Types (2026 Specific)</h2>

<h3>The Skeptical Mainstream Creator</h3>

<p>New: Mainstream journalists and creators are doing "I tried carnivore for 30 days" content. These are people without ideology. They're just experimenting. Some found it works, some didn't. This is healthy—more balanced coverage.</p>

<h3>The Academic Researcher</h3>

<p>More PhDs and MDs are looking at carnivore seriously now. Not many yet, but the trajectory is there. Expect more legitimate research starting in 2026.</p>

<h3>The Medical Professional (Non-MD)</h3>

<p>Nutritionists, physical therapists, coaches who specialize in carnivore. These are often underrated as credible voices. They're practitioners who see outcomes daily.</p>

<h2>What's Actually Happening (Meta-View)</h2>

<p><strong>The narrative split is getting bigger.</strong> On one side: "Carnivore is ancestral optimal, most people should do it." On the other: "This is dangerous and unsustainable." Both extremes are growing louder. Both are wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The practical middle ground is quieter.</strong> "Carnivore works great for some people, doesn't work for others, and it matters how you implement it" doesn't get engagement. But it's the most honest take.</p>

<p><strong>Women's voices are finally getting platform.</strong> Thank god. Female carnivore creators are exploding right now. This shifts the conversation from testosterone-soaked bro content to actual practical female-specific guidance.</p>

<p><strong>TikTok is outpacing YouTube.</strong> Younger people are getting carnivore education from 30-second clips, not 2-hour interviews. This is good and bad. Quick engagement, less depth.</p>

<h2>How to Navigate This Space As a Beginner</h2>

<p>Start here:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Watch Shawn Baker first.</strong> Get credible science foundation. 2-3 videos on basics.</li>
<li><strong>Then watch Ken Berry.</strong> See practical implementation. How does this actually work?</li>
<li><strong>Then decide what direction.</strong> Do you want more research (Shawn)? More lifestyle (Ken or Steak and Butter Gal)? More philosophy (Paul)? More depth (Rina)?</li>
<li><strong>Check our resources too.</strong> We've curated information specifically for common questions.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What I'm Watching For (2026 Predictions)</h2>

<p><strong>More mainstream creator coverage:</strong> Someone with 1M+ subscribers will do serious carnivore content. It's coming.</p>

<p><strong>Institutional research:</strong> Universities will fund carnivore studies. The controversy makes it fundable now.</p>

<p><strong>Creator drama:</strong> As the space grows, you'll see more conflict between schools of thought. Watch for this.</p>

<p><strong>New platforms:</strong> TikTok might get banned (US politics). Carnivore moves to Threads, Instagram Reels, or new platforms. Wherever the audience goes.</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>The creator landscape is credible now. You have real doctors, real researchers, real practitioners creating content. The bar has risen from 2023.</p>

<p>That's good. The downside: more conflicting information. More polarization. But better to have too many voices than no credible voices.</p>

<p>Pick creators who think like you do about rigor and pragmatism. Follow a few. Take what works. Ignore the rest.</p>

<p>The space is mature enough that you can be smart about your information diet.</p>
