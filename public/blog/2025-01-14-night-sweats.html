First week feels great. Then week two hits and you're waking up at 3 AM absolutely drenched.</p><p>Your bed looks like you showered in it.

By week four you'll be sleeping through the night like normal, better rested than you've been in years.</p><p>The night sweats are your body literally burning through the adaptation process.</p><p>—Chloe</p></body></html>
