That's it. No other meat. No organs. No fat from other sources. Just muscle meat from ruminants, electrolytes, and water.</p><h2>Why People Are Doing This</h2><p>Most carnivore people eat variety. Different meats, organs, beef, pork, eggs, etc. But some people feel better on just beef. Cleaner digestion. Better sleep. Less bloating.</p><p>Lion Diet is the experiment to find out if that's real or placebo.</p><p>And people are getting wild results. Like weirdly good results. Better skin. Stable energy. Deep sleep. No inflammation.</p><h2>The "Challenge" Aspect</h2><p>People are doing it for 30 days and documenting it. The community's engaged. People are supporting each other through it. And honestly? The social proof is real. You see someone post before/afters and you're like, "Wait, really?"</p><p>It's the most carnivore thing ever. Strip everything down. See what actually works. No complexity, no excuses.</p><h2>Is It Sustainable?</h2><p>For 30 days? Absolutely. After that? Depends on the person. Some people feel so good they never go back. Some people add back eggs and organs after 30 days and maintain the benefits.</p><p>The point isn't to stay on Lion forever. The point is to find your baseline and see what unnecessary stuff you've been eating.</p><h2>The Real Take</h2><p>Lion Diet isn't for everyone. But the fact that it works so well for some people is proof that simplification beats complexity every time.</p><p>Try it for January. See what happens.</p><p>—Chloe</p></body></html>
