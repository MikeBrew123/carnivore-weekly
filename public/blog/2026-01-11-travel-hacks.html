<p>You're doing great on carnivore at home. Your fridge is stocked. Your routine is dialed in. Then you book a flight.</p>

<p>And suddenly you're staring at airport food courts wondering if you're about to eat Cinnabon for the first time in six months.</p>

                <div class="tldr-box tldr-box--green">
                    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Pack beef jerky, hard-boiled eggs, cheese sticks, and pre-cooked bacon. TSA allows solid foods.</li>
                        <li>Airport hack: Most have sit-down restaurants with steak or burgers. Skip the food court.</li>
                        <li>Long flights: Eat before you board, fast during flight, or request special meals 48 hours ahead.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

<p>Travel is where most people fall off carnivore. Not because they want to quit, but because they didn't plan ahead and got stuck with no options. Here's how the community actually handles it.</p>

<h2>The Packing List: What to Bring</h2>

<p>TSA allows solid foods through security. Liquids are the problem. So your carry-on strategy is: pack dry, shelf-stable protein.</p>

<p><strong>Best carnivore travel foods (TSA-approved):</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li><strong>Beef jerky:</strong> Lightweight, doesn't need refrigeration, high protein. Pack 3-4 bags for a long trip.</li>
    <li><strong>Pork rinds:</strong> Crunchy, fatty, keeps forever. Good for snacking.</li>
    <li><strong>Hard-boiled eggs:</strong> Pre-peel them at home. Pack in a small container. Eat within 24 hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Cheese sticks or cheese cubes:</strong> Can survive a few hours unrefrigerated. Pack in a small cooler bag with ice pack if you're paranoid.</li>
    <li><strong>Pre-cooked bacon:</strong> Wrap in paper towels, pack in Ziplock. Smells like bacon on the plane (your seatmate will be jealous).</li>
    <li><strong>Carnivore bars:</strong> Carnivore Bar, EPIC bars, or Tanka bars. Convenient, expensive, but worth it for travel.</li>
    <li><strong>Canned fish:</strong> Sardines, mackerel, or salmon. Pack a fork. Don't care what people think.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Pro tip from the community:</strong> Bring salt packets. A lot of travel food is under-salted and you'll feel it.</p>

<p>If you want something easier than salt packets, <a href="http://elementallabs.refr.cc" rel="sponsored" style="color: var(--color-oxblood); text-decoration: underline;">LMNT electrolyte packets</a> are clutch for travel. They're designed for low-carb/carnivore (no sugar, just sodium, potassium, magnesium) and TSA-friendly. Toss a few in your bag, mix with water on the plane. This is a partner product we actually use. You don't need it if you're fine salting everything heavily, but it's convenient when you're stuck with airport food.</p>

<h2>Airport Strategy: Where to Actually Eat</h2>

<p>Most airports have at least one sit-down restaurant. That's where you go.</p>

<p><strong>What to order at airport restaurants:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li><strong>Steakhouse or burger place:</strong> Steak, burger (no bun), eggs, bacon. Easy win.</li>
    <li><strong>Breakfast spots:</strong> Eggs, bacon, sausage. Skip the toast and hash browns.</li>
    <li><strong>Seafood:</strong> Grilled fish or shrimp. Most airports have at least one seafood option.</li>
    <li><strong>Mexican:</strong> Carnitas or carne asada bowl. No rice, no beans, no tortilla. Just meat.</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, it's overpriced. Yes, the steak won't be amazing. But it's better than breaking your protocol because you got desperate.</p>

                </blockquote>

<p><strong>Food court options (if you're stuck):</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li>Five Guys: Burger, lettuce wrap, extra bacon</li>
    <li>Chipotle: Carnitas bowl, no rice/beans, extra meat</li>
    <li>Shake Shack: Burger, no bun, add egg</li>
    <li>Panda Express: Get the grilled chicken or beef, skip the rice (not ideal but workable)</li>
</ul>

<p>Most chains will accommodate "no bun" requests. Don't be shy about it.</p>

<h2>The Flight Itself: To Eat or Not to Eat</h2>

<p>Long flights are tricky. You're stuck in a metal tube for 10 hours and the meal service is pasta or pasta.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: Fast through the flight</strong></p>

<p>This is what a lot of carnivores do. Eat a big meal before you board. Don't eat on the plane. Eat when you land.</p>

<p>If you're fat-adapted, fasting for 10-12 hours is easy. You're not going to starve. You'll actually feel better than if you ate the airplane food.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: Special meal request</strong></p>

<p>Most airlines let you request special meals 24-48 hours before your flight. Look for:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li><strong>"Low carb meal"</strong> (usually chicken or fish with vegetables, you can eat the protein)</li>
    <li><strong>"Gluten-free meal"</strong> (sometimes has meat and eggs)</li>
    <li><strong>"Diabetic meal"</strong> (often higher protein, lower carb)</li>
</ul>

<p>It's not perfect, but it's better than the standard pasta tray.</p>

<p><strong>Option 3: Bring your own food</strong></p>

<p>Pack the foods I listed above. Eat your beef jerky and hard-boiled eggs mid-flight. Ignore the meal service.</p>

<p>Your seatmate might give you a weird look when you pull out pre-cooked bacon. You're fine.</p>

<h2>International Travel: The Extra Challenge</h2>

<p>Flying internationally adds complications: longer flights, customs rules, different food cultures.</p>

<p><strong>Customs rules for food:</strong></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li>Most countries don't allow you to bring meat products across borders. Check before you pack.</li>
    <li>Commercially packaged foods (jerky, bars) are usually fine. Fresh meat is not.</li>
    <li>When in doubt, finish your food before you land or toss it before customs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Eating carnivore in other countries:</strong></p>

<p>Good news: Meat is universal. Every culture has steak, chicken, fish, or eggs.</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li><strong>Europe:</strong> Easy. Steakhouses everywhere. Order meat, skip the bread and potatoes.</li>
    <li><strong>Asia:</strong> Harder but doable. Grilled meats, hot pot (meat only), Korean BBQ, Japanese yakiniku. Avoid sauces with sugar.</li>
    <li><strong>South America:</strong> Easiest of all. Argentinian steakhouses. Brazilian churrasco. You're living your best life.</li>
    <li><strong>Middle East:</strong> Kebabs, grilled chicken, lamb. Easy carnivore wins.</li>
</ul>

<p>The trick is finding sit-down restaurants instead of relying on street food or convenience stores.</p>

<h2>Hotel Hacks: Staying Carnivore on the Road</h2>

<p>Once you're at your destination, you need a strategy for meals.</p>

<p><strong>Hotel breakfast buffet:</strong></p>

<p>Most hotels have eggs, bacon, sausage. Load up on protein in the morning and you can skip lunch if needed.</p>

<p><strong>Grocery stores:</strong></p>

<p>Hit a local grocery store when you arrive. Buy:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 15px;">
    <li>Pre-cooked rotisserie chicken</li>
    <li>Deli meat and cheese</li>
    <li>Hard-boiled eggs</li>
    <li>Canned fish</li>
</ul>

<p>Keep it in your hotel fridge. Now you have emergency backup meals.</p>

<p><strong>Room service / delivery apps:</strong></p>

<p>Most hotels and Uber Eats have steak, burgers, or grilled chicken. Order bunless, skip the sides, add extra protein.</p>

<h2>The Mindset Shift</h2>

<p>Here's the thing about traveling carnivore: It's not as hard as you think once you accept that your meals won't be perfect.</p>

<p>You're not going to get grassfed ribeye at the airport. That's okay. You're getting protein and fat, staying in ketosis, and avoiding the foods that make you feel like garbage.</p>

<p>Travel is temporary. One suboptimal steak at an airport restaurant won't ruin your progress. But caving and eating pizza because you didn't plan ahead will make you feel worse.</p>

<p>Plan ahead. Pack snacks. Know where the airport restaurants are. And if worst comes to worst, fasting for a few hours won't kill you.</p>

<p>The community travels all the time. You're not the first carnivore to get on a plane. You'll figure it out.</p>
