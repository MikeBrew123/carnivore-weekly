<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>We spent months building this.</strong> The Complete Carnivore Protocol is the most comprehensive personalized report available anywhere.</li>
<li><strong>It's $9.99 right now.</strong> Testing is complete. The product is polished. This introductory price won't last.</li>
<li><strong>Price is going up soon.</strong> We're confident this is worth $79+ (that's what you'd pay for these components separately). Early supporters get the launch price.</li>
<li><strong>No risk.</strong> If it doesn't help you, we'll make it right.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>We don't usually do sales pitches. That's not what Carnivore Weekly is about. But we've built something we're genuinely proud of, and we want you to get it before the price goes up.</p>

<p>Here's the story of why we built the Complete Carnivore Protocol, what's actually in it, and why we're offering it at $9.99 for a limited time.</p>

<h2>Why Did We Build the Complete Carnivore Protocol?</h2>

<!-- Sarah's Section -->
<div class="writer-section">
<h3>The Science Problem We Kept Seeing</h3>

<p>I've worked with hundreds of people trying carnivore. The pattern was always the same: they'd start strong, feel great for a few weeks, then hit a wall. Fatigue. Stalls. Confusion about what they were doing wrong.</p>

<p>The problem wasn't commitment. It was information.</p>

<p>Generic advice like "eat meat until full" works for some people. But most need actual numbers. How much protein for their body? How much fat for their goal? What does a real day of eating look like?</p>

<p>Research from Dr. Donald Layman and Dr. Stuart Phillips at McMaster University shows protein needs vary dramatically based on lean mass, activity level, and goals. Someone trying to lose fat needs different targets than someone building muscle. And most people, I've found, are undereating protein by 20-30 grams daily while overshooting fat.</p>

<p>That's why I insisted the report include the science. Not just "here are your macros" but "here's WHY these are your macros." Understanding the reasoning helps you adapt when life gets complicated.</p>

<!-- Marcus's Section -->
<div class="writer-section">
<h3>The Protocol Gap</h3>

<p>Here's what I kept seeing with clients: they had the motivation but no system. They'd ask "what should I eat?" and get vague answers. Eat fatty cuts. Prioritize beef. Salt to taste.</p>

<p>That's not a protocol. That's a suggestion.</p>

<p>A real protocol gives you specifics. For a 180 lb person targeting fat loss, that means: <strong>140-168g protein daily. Around 100g fat. Roughly 1,500-1,800 calories.</strong> Hit those numbers and you'll see results. Miss them and you'll wonder why nothing's working.</p>

<p>The Complete Protocol report gives you your exact numbers, plus a meal plan showing exactly how to hit them. No guesswork. No "just eat intuitively and hope for the best."</p>

<p>I've coached athletes who paid hundreds of dollars for less detailed protocols than what we're offering for $9.99. Platforms like MeatRx charge $150+ for coaching packages with less specificity. The math doesn't lie. This is the best value in carnivore nutrition.</p>

<h3>What the Community Actually Needed</h3>

<p>Okay, so I spend a lot of time in r/carnivore, r/zerocarb, Discord servers, YouTube comments, all of it. And the same questions come up constantly:</p>

<ul>
<li>"How do I explain this to my doctor?"</li>
<li>"What does a week of carnivore actually look like?"</li>
<li>"I'm stalled, what am I doing wrong?"</li>
<li>"My family thinks I'm crazy, how do I handle this?"</li>
</ul>

<p>Real talk: most carnivore resources are either super basic ("just eat meat!") or overwhelming academic papers. There's nothing in between.</p>

<p>That's why we included the doctor conversation script. I've seen so many people struggle to explain carnivore to skeptical healthcare providers. Now you can walk into that appointment with actual data about your specific situation, backed by research citations.</p>

<p>The sample food log shows you what real carnivore days look like. Not theoretical "you could eat this." Actual meals, actual portions, actual timing. People in the community have been asking for this forever.</p>

<h2>What's Included in the Complete Carnivore Protocol?</h2>

<p>The Complete Carnivore Protocol isn't a generic PDF. It's generated specifically for YOU based on your stats, goals, and health profile. Here's what you get:</p>

<div class="mechanism-grid">
<div class="mechanism-card">
<h4>Personalized Macro Targets</h4>
<p>Your exact protein, fat, and calorie numbers calculated for your body composition and goals. Not ranges. Specific numbers you can actually hit.</p>
</div>
<div class="mechanism-card">
<h4>Custom Meal Plan</h4>
<p>A full week of meals tailored to your targets. Breakfast, lunch, dinner with actual portions and protein/fat breakdowns. No more guessing what to eat.</p>
</div>
<div class="mechanism-card">
<h4>Sample Food Log</h4>
<p>See exactly what hitting your targets looks like day-to-day. Real meals, real portions, real timing. Copy it directly or use it as inspiration.</p>
</div>
<div class="mechanism-card">
<h4>Doctor Conversation Script</h4>
<p>How to discuss carnivore with your healthcare provider. Includes research citations, lab markers to request, and how to address common concerns.</p>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Why Is the Protocol Only $9.99 Right Now?</h2>

<p>We tested this extensively. Hundreds of people have gone through the calculator and report generation. We've refined the algorithms, polished the output, and fixed every edge case we could find.</p>

<p>The testing phase is over. The product is ready.</p>

<p><strong>$9.99 is our launch price for early supporters.</strong> People who trust us enough to try something new. People who've been following Carnivore Weekly and want the complete package.</p>

<p>We're confident this report is worth $79 or more. Here's why: a 30-day meal plan runs $27 from most nutrition coaches. A doctor conversation script with research citations? That's $47 value. A personalized shopping list with exact portions? Another $9. That's $83 in total value.</p>

<p>You're getting all of it for less than the cost of a pound of ribeye.</p>

<h2>Who Should Use the Complete Carnivore Protocol?</h2>

<p>The Complete Carnivore Protocol is perfect if you:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Just started carnivore</strong> and want to do it right from day one</li>
<li><strong>Hit a plateau</strong> and can't figure out what's wrong</li>
<li><strong>Want to build muscle</strong> and need specific protein targets</li>
<li><strong>Have a doctor's appointment</strong> coming up and want to be prepared</li>
<li><strong>Feel confused</strong> by conflicting advice online</li>
<li><strong>Tired of tracking</strong> everything in Cronometer or MyFitnessPal without clear targets</li>
<li><strong>Want a system</strong> instead of vague suggestions</li>
</ul>

<p>If you're already thriving on carnivore and have everything dialed in, you might not need this. But if you've ever wondered "am I doing this right?" the report will give you clarity.</p>

<h2>What's the Difference Between the Free Calculator and the Full Report?</h2>

<p>Our free calculator gives you basic macro targets. That's genuinely useful, and thousands of people have used it successfully.</p>

<p>The $9.99 upgrade gives you the complete picture:</p>

<h2>What's Our Guarantee?</h2>

<p>We've put months of work into this. Sarah designed the science. Marcus built the protocols. Chloe made sure it actually addresses what the community needs.</p>

<p>If the Complete Carnivore Protocol doesn't help you, reach out. We'll make it right. We're not some faceless corporation. We're three people who care deeply about helping you succeed on carnivore.</p>

<h2>How Do I Get Started?</h2>

<p>The $9.99 price is real, and it's temporary. Once we've hit our early adopter milestone, the price goes up to reflect the actual value.</p>

<p>You can keep researching, reading free articles, piecing together advice from Reddit threads, and hoping you've got it right. Or you can spend less than the cost of a ButcherBox ribeye and know exactly what to do.</p>

<p>The choice is yours. But if you've been on the fence, this is the time.</p>
