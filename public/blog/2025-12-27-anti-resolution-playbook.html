                <!-- Post Content -->
                <div class="post-content">

<p>Everyone's making resolutions. "This year I'll get healthy. This year I'll finally lose weight. This year I'll change." You know how that ends. February comes, and you're back where you started.</p>
<div class="tldr-box">
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Carnivore isn't a resolution</strong> — it's a system. Systems work when resolutions fail.</li>
<li><strong>Constraint beats willpower</strong> — fewer choices = fewer failure points</li>
<li><strong>Start with one meal</strong> — lunch for two weeks, then add dinner</li>
<li><strong>Results in weeks, not months</strong> — energy up in days, clarity in two weeks</li>
<li><strong>Identity shift:</strong> "I eat meat" vs. "I'm trying a diet"</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Carnivore is different. It's not a resolution. It's a system. Here's how to use it that way, and why it actually works when resolutions don't.</p>
<h2>Why Resolutions Fail and Carnivore Doesn't</h2>
<div class="vs-grid">
<div class="vs-card fail">
<h4>❌ Resolutions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vague goals:</strong> "Get healthy" means nothing actionable</li>
<li><strong>Endless decisions:</strong> What to eat? Is this allowed? What's right?</li>
<li><strong>Relies on motivation:</strong> Motivation fades by week 3</li>
<li><strong>Slow results:</strong> Months before you see anything</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="vs-divider">VS</div>
<div class="vs-card win">
<h4>✓ Carnivore System</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Specific answer:</strong> What should I eat? Meat. Done.</li>
<li><strong>Zero decisions:</strong> No willpower drain on food choices</li>
<li><strong>Becomes identity:</strong> It's just what you do by February</li>
<li><strong>Fast results:</strong> Energy in days, clarity in weeks</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
                        "The number one thing that kills diet consistency is decision fatigue. Carnivore removes all of that."
                    </blockquote>
<h2>The Anti-Resolution Framework</h2>
<p>Instead of a resolution, build a system:</p>
<div class="framework-grid">
<div class="framework-card">
<h4>Constraint &gt; Willpower</h4>
<div class="formula">
<span class="old">Rely on willpower</span>
<span class="arrow">→</span>
<span class="new">Eliminate choices</span>
</div>
<p>Don't rely on willpower to avoid certain foods. Eliminate them. Clean out your kitchen. Donate the cookies. Now the constraint does the work, not you.</p>
</div>
<div class="framework-card">
<h4>Small Start &gt; Big Change</h4>
<div class="formula">
<span class="old">"Go carnivore"</span>
<span class="arrow">→</span>
<span class="new">Meat for lunch</span>
</div>
<p>Don't "go carnivore" all at once. Eat meat for lunch. One meal. That works. After two weeks, add dinner. The big change is built from small wins.</p>
</div>
<div class="framework-card">
<h4>Identity &gt; Behavior</h4>
<div class="formula">
<span class="old">"I'm trying carnivore"</span>
<span class="arrow">→</span>
<span class="new">"I eat meat"</span>
</div>
<p>Once your identity is set, behavior follows automatically. You don't decide every meal. You just do what someone who eats meat does.</p>
</div>
<div class="framework-card">
<h4>Simplicity &gt; Perfection</h4>
<div class="formula">
<span class="old">Optimize everything</span>
<span class="arrow">→</span>
<span class="new">Just eat meat</span>
</div>
<p>You don't need grass-fed. You don't need to track macros. You don't need to fast. Just eat meat. Consistency beats perfection every time.</p>
</div>
</div>

<figcaption>The answer to "what should I eat?" is always meat.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>The Actual Playbook</h2>
<div class="playbook-timeline">
<div class="playbook-week">
<div class="week-num">Week 1</div>
<div class="week-content">
<h4>Add Meat</h4>
<p>Eat meat for lunch every day. Just lunch. Ribeye, ground beef, whatever. Make it delicious so you actually want to eat it. That's the only change. Everything else stays the same.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="playbook-week">
<div class="week-num">Week 2-3</div>
<div class="week-content">
<h4>Add Another Meal</h4>
<p>Now eat meat for lunch and dinner. Breakfast stays the same. Again, no other changes. No need to optimize yet. Just add the meal.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="playbook-week">
<div class="week-num">Week 4</div>
<div class="week-content">
<h4>Evaluate</h4>
<p>How do you feel? More energy? Different appetite? Sleeping better? If yes to any of those, you're onto something. Keep going. If no, carnivore might not be for you. But you'll know instead of wondering.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="playbook-week">
<div class="week-num">Week 4+</div>
<div class="week-content">
<h4>Optimize</h4>
<p>Now you can optimize. More fat. Less meat (if you want). Add organs for nutrients. Find the version of carnivore that feels best for you.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Why January Isn't Special</h2>
<p>Here's the secret: January 1st is arbitrary. The only thing that changes is the calendar. You can start March 15th and it works just as well. But psychologically, January is a fresh start. Use that if it helps. But understand that the magic isn't in the date. It's in starting and not stopping.</p>
<blockquote class="pull-quote">
                        "Carnivore is restrictive, which sounds bad but is actually the advantage. Fewer choices. Fewer decisions. Less willpower needed."
                    </blockquote>
<h2>How to Not Quit</h2>
<div class="anti-quit-box">
<h4>Anti-Quit Protocol</h4>
<div class="anti-quit-tips">
<div class="anti-quit-tip">
<span class="num">1</span>
<span class="text"><strong>Tell someone.</strong> Share your plan. Not for motivation, but for accountability. When you skip meat for a day, you'll think about telling someone you quit. That matters.</span>
</div>
<div class="anti-quit-tip">
<span class="num">2</span>
<span class="text"><strong>Track something simple.</strong> Not calories. Not weight. Just "did I eat carnivore today?" A simple yes/no. A streak of yeses is satisfying. That streak motivates itself.</span>
</div>
<div class="anti-quit-tip">
<span class="num">3</span>
<span class="text"><strong>Plan your environment.</strong> Have meat in the freezer. Always. When you're hungry and there's no easy carbs but there's meat, you eat meat. Easy choice beats willpower every time.</span>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>The Anti-Resolution Take</h2>
<p>Don't make resolutions. Don't rely on willpower. Don't expect it to be easy. Do build a system. Do remove friction. Do start small. Do track progress. Do build identity. Carnivore makes all of that easier because it's simple.</p>
<p>January 1st is coming. You don't need a resolution. You need a system. Carnivore is the system. It's specific. It's simple. It works. Stop planning and start eating meat. That's all you need to do.</p>
<div class="key-takeaways">
<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Systems beat resolutions:</strong> Carnivore's simplicity removes decision fatigue—the #1 killer of diet consistency.</li>
<li><strong>Constraint does the work:</strong> Clean out your kitchen. When there's only meat, you eat meat. No willpower needed.</li>
<li><strong>Start with lunch:</strong> One meal for two weeks. Add dinner in week 3. Build slowly from small wins.</li>
<li><strong>Shift your identity:</strong> "I eat meat" is who you are, not something you're trying. Behavior follows identity.</li>
<li><strong>Track binary:</strong> Did I eat carnivore today? Yes/No. Streak of yeses becomes self-motivating.</li>
</ol>
