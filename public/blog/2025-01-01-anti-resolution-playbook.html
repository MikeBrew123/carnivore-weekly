<h1>The Anti-Resolution Playbook: Why Goals Beat Resolutions Every Time</h1>

<p>New Year's resolutions are trash. Let me be direct about that.</p>

<p>They're designed to fail. You wake up January 1st with explosive motivation, you set some vague goal like "eat healthier" or "lose weight," you crush it for a week, then by January 10th you're back to your old habits wondering what happened.</p>

<p>That's not you failing. That's the system being broken.</p>

<p>Here's what actually works instead.</p>

<h2>Resolutions vs. Goals: The Fundamental Difference</h2>

<p>A resolution is a decision. A goal is a target with a plan.</p>

<p>Resolution: "I'm going to stick to carnivore in 2025."</p>

<p>Goal: "I'm eating only meat and salt for 30 days. After 30 days, I'll measure energy levels and body composition. If metrics improve, I continue. If not, I adjust."</p>

<p>One is hope. One is a system.</p>

<p>The difference? Goals are specific, measurable, and connected to reality. Resolutions are wishes.</p>

<h2>The Problem with "All or Nothing" Thinking</h2>

<p>Most people who fail at carnivore do it because they think one slip-up means failure.</p>

<p>You have a birthday party. Someone offers you cake. You eat a slice. Suddenly you think the whole thing is ruined, so you eat a whole cake, then resume "perfectly" next Monday.</p>

<p>That's not how results work.</p>

<p>Real life is 95% compliance, not 100%. You miss meals. You get pressured at dinners. You travel. Life happens.</p>

<p>A real goal accounts for this. A resolution ignores it and then punishes you when reality shows up.</p>

<h2>The Three-Layer Goal System That Actually Works</h2>

<p>Layer 1: The Big Goal (the why)</p>

<p>Not "lose weight." Why do you want that? More energy? Better sleep? Look better in photos? Run without getting tired? Be present for your kids?</p>

<p>Pick one. Write it down. Make it visceral. Don't let it be abstract.</p>

<p>Layer 2: The Quarterly Target (the measurable)</p>

<p>In 90 days, what specifically changes? Weight down 15 pounds? Energy up? Sleeping through the night? No afternoon crashes?</p>

<p>Something you can actually measure in three months, not something vague.</p>

<p>Layer 3: The Weekly Protocol (the daily)</p>

<p>This is the thing you actually control. Not "be healthier." But "eat meat and salt. No processed food. Check in on Sundays about how I feel."</p>

<p>The daily action is what moves the needle. The goal just makes sure you know why you're doing the daily action.</p>

<h2>The Math Behind Consistency</h2>

<p>You don't need perfection. You need consistency.</p>

<p>If you stick to carnivore 80% of the time over a year, you still see massive results. Most people see results at 70% compliance.</p>

<p>That means you can miss meals. You can have slip-ups. You can be human.</p>

<p>What kills progress is the all-or-nothing collapse. One cheat meal becomes a cheat week becomes a cheat month, and then it's February and you're back to zero.</p>

<p>If you build a goal that expects 80% compliance, you win. If you build a resolution that demands 100%, you lose.</p>

<h2>The Accountability Hack</h2>

<p>Most people set goals in their head and wonder why they fail.</p>

<p>Write them down. Specific. Measurable. With dates.</p>

<p>"In 90 days (April 1), I will have stable energy throughout the day (no 3pm crashes), sleep through the night, and weigh 185 pounds. My weekly protocol is meat, salt, water, nothing else. I check in every Sunday."</p>

<p>That's not a resolution. That's a plan with teeth.</p>

<p>Share it with someone. Not to brag. To be accountable. Text a friend every Sunday with your status. Sounds simple. It works.</p>

<h2>Why Carnivore Is Your Competitive Advantage</h2>

<p>Here's the thing about eating only meat.</p>

<p>Most diets require constant willpower. You're always deciding what to eat. Carnivore removes that. Your decision tree shrinks to one choice: am I eating meat right now?</p>

<p>That's not restriction. That's freedom from decision fatigue.</p>

<p>A goal on carnivore is easier to stick to than a goal on any other diet, because you're not battling yourself every meal.</p>

<p>Use that advantage. Build your goal around it.</p>

<h2>The 30-Day Reset</h2>

<p>You don't need a full year to see if carnivore works for you.</p>

<p>30 days. Meat and salt, nothing else. Measure three things: energy, sleep, weight.</p>

<p>After 30 days, you'll know. Not guess. Know.</p>

<p>If it works, great. You just built your 90-day goal on solid data. If it doesn't, you didn't waste a year wondering.</p>

<p>Most people feel dramatically different by day 30. Some take longer. But 30 days is enough data to decide if you're in or out.</p>

<h2>The Real Anti-Resolution</h2>

<p>Don't promise yourself you'll be perfect in 2025.</p>

<p>Promise yourself you'll be consistent. That you'll measure results. That when you slip up, you don't collapse, you just keep going.</p>

<p>Promise yourself you'll actually do the thing instead of just thinking about it.</p>

<p>That's not a resolution. That's a commitment.</p>

<p>And commitments stick.</p>
