<h2>The January Wave</h2>

<p>Every January brings new people to carnivore. This year feels different though. The community is bigger, more vocal, and there's less tolerance for BS.</p>

<p>I spent the last month watching Reddit threads, YouTube comments, and Discord conversations. Here's what's actually happening out there.</p>

<h2>The Big Win: Electrolytes Are Finally Normal</h2>

<p>Remember when everyone said "just eat meat and salt" and people ended up with leg cramps and headaches?</p>

<p>That's changing. More people are starting with proper electrolytes from day one. Less suffering through adaptation. Less people quitting in week two because they feel terrible.</p>

<p>The most common stack I'm seeing: salt on everything, magnesium before bed, potassium if you're getting cramps. Simple. Effective.</p>

<p>LMNT is showing up everywhere. Not because it's magic, but because it's easy. People who wouldn't bother measuring out electrolytes will drink a packet.</p>

<h2>The Debate: Beef vs. Everything Else</h2>

<p>Here's where things got heated this month.</p>

<p>One camp says beef only, no exceptions. The other camp says add eggs, fish, chicken, pork, whatever works for you.</p>

<p>What I'm seeing in practice: most people who stick with it long-term eat mostly beef but don't stress about other animal foods. The ones who struggle are either trying to do chicken-only to save money or they're eating nothing but ribeyes and wondering why their wallet hurts.</p>

<p>Ground beef is still king. It's cheap, it's versatile, and it works. People who start with expensive cuts often quit when they realize the cost. People who start with ground beef and eggs stick around.</p>

<h2>The Reality Check: Adaptation Takes Longer Than You Think</h2>

<p>Two weeks keeps coming up. "I've been carnivore for two weeks and I don't feel amazing yet, what am I doing wrong?"</p>

<p>Nothing. You're doing nothing wrong. Two weeks is barely enough time for your body to figure out what's happening.</p>

<p>The people reporting real benefits are at 60+ days. That's when energy stabilizes. That's when digestion sorts itself out. That's when the mental clarity everyone talks about actually shows up.</p>

<p>But social media makes it sound like day 3 should be life-changing. It's not. It's usually just less bloating and maybe some better sleep. The big stuff takes time.</p>

<h2>The Trend: More Women, More Success Stories</h2>

<p>Women are posting more this year. And they're getting results.</p>

<p>Hormonal issues, autoimmune flares, thyroid problems - carnivore seems to help more than standard low-carb for a lot of women. The pattern I'm seeing: start strict, see what improves, slowly test adding things back.</p>

<p>Also seeing fewer "I'm afraid to eat fat" posts from women. That mental block used to derail a lot of people. Now it's more accepted that fat isn't the enemy.</p>

<h2>The Struggle: Travel Still Sucks</h2>

<p>This came up constantly in January. People trying to stay carnivore while traveling.</p>

<p>Airports are rough. Hotel breakfasts are worse. People are packing beef sticks and hard-boiled eggs like their lives depend on it.</p>

<p>Best travel hack I saw: someone called ahead to their hotel and asked if the kitchen could do plain eggs and bacon for breakfast. They said yes. Simple, but most people don't think to ask.</p>

<p>Road trips are easier. Pack a cooler, find steakhouses, order burgers without buns. Not glamorous, but it works.</p>

<h2>The Shift: Less Dogma, More Practicality</h2>

<p>The hardcore "zero exceptions ever" crowd is quieter this year. Maybe they're still out there, but the conversation has shifted.</p>

<p>Now it's more: What are your goals? What works for your body? Are you getting results?</p>

<p>People are testing things. Adding back dairy to see what happens. Trying carnivore for 90 days, then slowly reintroducing foods. Treating it like a tool instead of a religion.</p>

<p>This is healthier. Dogma makes people quit when they slip up. Flexibility keeps people going.</p>

<h2>The Data: Bloodwork Is Better</h2>

<p>More people posting their lab results this month. And the pattern is clear.</p>

<p>Triglycerides down. HDL up. Inflammation markers down. A1C improving for people who came in with pre-diabetes.</p>

<p>LDL is all over the place, which freaks people out. But when you look at the full picture - triglycerides, HDL, particle size - most people's cardiovascular risk is improving, not getting worse.</p>

<p>Doctors are still concerned, though. That's the other pattern. "My numbers are better but my doctor thinks I'm going to die." Finding a doctor who understands this way of eating is still hard.</p>

<h2>The Surprise: Fewer Supplement Pushes</h2>

<p>Last year, everyone was selling something. Organ supplements, collagen powders, weird peptides.</p>

<p>This year? Less of that. More focus on just eating food.</p>

<p>The only supplements that keep coming up consistently: electrolytes (because they actually help) and occasionally magnesium or vitamin D if someone's deficient.</p>

<p>People are tired of being sold to. They want to know what works, not what someone's affiliate link is for.</p>

<h2>The Warning: Watch Out for Burnout</h2>

<p>This is subtle, but I'm seeing it. People who go all-in, see great results in the first few months, then hit a wall around month 4-6.</p>

<p>It's not physical. It's mental. They're tired of being the weird one. Tired of explaining their diet. Tired of packing their own food everywhere.</p>

<p>The ones who push through this phase do fine. The ones who don't usually end up back on a standard diet within a year.</p>

<p>Solution seems to be: find your people. Online or in person, doesn't matter. Just don't try to do this completely alone for months on end.</p>

<h2>The Prediction: This Gets More Mainstream</h2>

<p>Five years ago, carnivore was a fringe thing. Now it's everywhere. More studies, more doctors talking about it, more regular people trying it.</p>

<p>It's not going to replace veganism or become the default diet. But it's not going away either.</p>

<p>What I think happens next: more people use carnivore as a short-term intervention. 90 days to fix a problem, then transition to something more flexible. And that's fine. It doesn't have to be forever for it to be useful.</p>

<h2>What's Actually Working</h2>

<p>Strip away the debates and the trends, here's what consistently works for people:</p>

<p>Start simple. Meat, salt, water. Add electrolytes if you feel off. Give it 60 days minimum before judging results.</p>

<p>Track something. Weight, energy, sleep, whatever matters to you. You need to know if it's working.</p>

<p>Don't evangelize. Just do it quietly and let results speak for themselves.</p>

<p>Find one or two people who get it. Online or in person. You need someone to talk to who won't think you're insane.</p>

<p>That's the pattern. That's what works in 2026, just like it worked in 2025.</p>

<p>The community is bigger now. More resources, more support, more success stories. But the fundamentals haven't changed. Eat meat. Be patient. Get results.</p>
