<p>You've done the reading. You've watched the testimonials. You're ready to start carnivore, but you're staring at your grocery list wondering if you're about to make a terrible mistake. Take a breath. This is simpler than the internet makes it sound.</p>

<p>I've guided hundreds of clients through their first month on carnivore. Most people overthink it. They worry about electrolytes, macros, and meal timing before they've even bought their first ribeye. Here's what actually matters in your first 30 days.</p>

<h2>Week 1: The Basics Only</h2>

<p>Start with beef. Not because other meats are bad, but because beef is nutrient-dense, filling, and hard to mess up. Buy ground beef (80/20 or 73/27), ribeye, or chuck roast. Don't waste money on grass-fed yet. You're learning what works for your body, not optimizing.</p>

<p>Eat when you're hungry. Stop when you're full. This sounds obvious, but most people starting carnivore are coming from years of ignoring hunger cues. Your body is relearning how to signal satiety. Let it.</p>

<p>Here's what week one looks like for most people: You'll eat more than you think you should. That's fine. You'll probably eat 2-3 times per day, but some people naturally fall into one meal. Both are normal. You might feel great on day 2 and terrible on day 4. Also normal.</p>

<p>The most common mistake is not eating enough fat. If you're buying lean cuts, add butter. If you're hungry an hour after eating, you didn't eat enough fat. Your body is switching fuel sources. It needs the fat to make that transition smooth.</p>

<p>Hydration matters more than you think. You're losing water weight fast as your body dumps glycogen. Drink when you're thirsty, but don't force it. Add salt to your food. More than feels right. You're not getting hidden sodium from processed foods anymore.</p>

<h2>Week 2-3: The Adaptation Phase</h2>

<p>This is where most people quit. Not because carnivore doesn't work, but because they hit the adaptation dip and think something's wrong.</p>

<p>Your energy might tank around day 10-14. You might get headaches. You might feel like your workouts are terrible. This isn't carnivore failing you. This is your body switching from burning sugar to burning fat. It takes time. The research shows metabolic adaptation can take 2-4 weeks for most people.</p>

<p>What helps: Salt. Seriously, more salt. If you're getting headaches or feeling foggy, try a pinch of salt in water. Most adaptation symptoms are electrolyte-related, and sodium is usually the culprit.</p>

<p>Your digestion is going to change. Some people get constipated. Some get diarrhea. Both usually resolve by week three. Your gut microbiome is shifting. You're digesting more protein and fat than ever before. Give it time.</p>

<p>Don't add back carbs to "fix" the adaptation symptoms. That just resets the clock. Push through. By day 18-21, most people report energy coming back stronger than before.</p>

<p>Now you can start experimenting. Try different cuts of beef. Add eggs if you want. Some people do great with eggs from day one. Others find eggs cause inflammation until they're more adapted. There's no universal rule here.</p>

<h2>Week 4: Finding Your Pattern</h2>

<p>By week four, you should have a sense of your natural eating rhythm. Most people settle into 1-2 meals per day. Not because they're forcing it, but because they're genuinely not hungry more often than that.</p>

<p>This is when you can think about variety. Add other meats if you want. Pork, chicken, fish, lamb. But beef should still be your foundation. It's the most nutrient-complete option, and it's what most people feel best eating daily.</p>

<p>Your appetite will probably be lower than week one. This freaks people out. They think they should be eating the same amount forever. You won't. As you become fat-adapted, your body gets more efficient. You'll naturally eat less because you're using your own body fat for fuel between meals.</p>

<p>Some people lose weight fast in the first month. Some don't. Both are normal. If you're coming from a high-carb diet, you'll drop water weight immediately. That's not fat loss, it's glycogen depletion. Real fat loss is slower and steadier.</p>

<p>Sleep often improves by week four. You might wake up earlier without an alarm. You might notice you're not crashing in the afternoon anymore. These are signs your metabolism is stabilizing.</p>

<p>Here's what you don't need in your first 30 days: supplements (unless you have a diagnosed deficiency), organ meats (helpful but not required), expensive cuts of meat, a coach, or a strict meal plan. You need beef, salt, water, and patience.</p>

<p>The biggest predictor of success isn't your starting weight or your previous diet. It's whether you can resist the urge to complicate this. Carnivore works because it's simple. Keep it that way.</p>

<p>After 30 days, you'll know if this is sustainable for you. Most people feel significantly better and want to continue. Some decide it's not for them, and that's fine too. But you can't judge carnivore based on week one or even week two. Give it the full month.</p>

<p>If you're still feeling worse at day 30 than you did at the start, something's off. Either you're not eating enough fat, you're under-eating overall, or you have an underlying issue that needs medical attention. But for most people, day 30 is when everything clicks.</p>
