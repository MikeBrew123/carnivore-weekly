## 📌 KEY INSIGHTS FOR CONTENT TEAMS

## ❌ WHAT NOT TO DO

- ❌ Don't focus on long-form blog posts alone (underperforming)
- ❌ Don't bury the Calculator in menus (it's your star)
- ❌ Don't create "nice to have" content (focus on problem-solving)
- ❌ Don't forget internal linking to top pages
- ❌ Don't ignore that Wiki/educational content = engagement

## 📊 TRACKING YOUR PROGRESS

**Check these metrics weekly:**
- Is Calculator staying #1?
- Are new tool pages gaining traction?
- Is Archive traffic improving?
- Are visitor pages-per-session staying 20+?

**Red flags to watch:**
- If top pages drop 50%+ = traffic shift detected
- If pages-per-session drops below 15 = content quality issue
- If new content gets <100 views in first week = wrong angle

## 🎯 BOTTOM LINE FOR AGENTS

**Your audience wants:**
1. **Practical Tools** that solve real problems (macro tracking)
2. **Educational Resources** they can bookmark and return to (Wiki)
3. **Curated Lists** that save them research time (Channels)

**Write with this framework:**
- Does this solve a problem? → YES = likely to perform well
- Will someone reference this later? → YES = likely to perform well  
- Does this add to existing resources? → YES = likely to perform well
- Is this just opinion/news? → NO = likely to underperform

**Your compass: Follow the data.** People are telling you with their clicks what they want. Give them more of that.
