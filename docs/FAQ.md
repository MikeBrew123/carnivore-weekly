## General Questions

### Q: What changed on the Carnivore Weekly homepage?

A: On January 8, 2026, we redesigned the homepage with a new "Bento Grid" layout and five new features:

1. **Bento Grid Layout** - Organized content grid showing more information above the fold
2. **Trending Topics Explorer** - See what the community is discussing
3. **Wiki Auto-Linker** - Interactive definitions for health terms
4. **Sentiment Threads** - View multiple perspectives (positive, neutral, negative)
5. **Weekly Content Integration** - Sarah's health insights featured prominently

The design maintains Carnivore Weekly's premium aesthetic while making content more discoverable.

### Q: Why did you redesign the homepage?

A: We redesigned for three main reasons:

1. **Better Content Discovery**: The old layout made important content hard to find. The new grid shows 30-50% more content above the fold.

2. **Enhanced Learning**: Interactive features like wiki definitions and sentiment threads help you understand topics better.

3. **Modern Experience**: The Bento Grid layout is contemporary and elegant, while maintaining our editorial premium feel.

User research showed people wanted to discover trending community topics and understand different perspectives—the new design delivers exactly that.

### Q: Is this design available on mobile?

A: Yes! All features work seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop. The layout automatically adapts:

- **Desktop** (1100px+): 3-column grid
- **Tablet** (768-1099px): 2-column grid
- **Mobile** (375-767px): Single column stack

Everything scales perfectly for your screen size. Try visiting on different devices to see how it adapts.

### Q: Is there a way to go back to the old design?

A: No, we've fully transitioned to the new design. However, if you have specific features you preferred in the old design, please let us know via our feedback form. We're open to improvements.

### Q: Does the redesign affect the content? Are videos still curated the same way?

A: No change to content curation. Videos are still collected from the top 10 carnivore YouTube creators, analyzed with Claude AI, and curated by our team. Only the layout and presentation changed.

## Trending Topics Questions

### Q: How do I find trending topics?

A: Look for the **"Trending Topics"** section on the homepage:

- **Desktop**: Usually in the upper-right grid area
- **Tablet**: Dedicated section below the featured content
- **Mobile**: Full-width section you scroll to

Click any trending topic to expand it and see more details.

### Q: Why is this topic listed as "trending"?

A: Topics trend based on community engagement:

1. We collect all YouTube comments from featured videos
2. We extract topics/keywords mentioned
3. We calculate an engagement score: (comment count × weight) + (replies × weight) + (upvotes × weight)
4. Topics are ranked by score and refresh weekly

Higher engagement = trending. It's data-driven, not editorial.

### Q: Can I suggest a topic to track?

A: Yes! Email us at topics@carnivoreweekly.com with your suggestion. Include:
- What topic you'd like to see tracked
- Why it's important
- Specific questions you have about it

We review suggestions weekly and may add them to trending analysis.

### Q: Why does a "spam" topic sometimes appear?

A: The trending algorithm sometimes catches low-quality content. If you see spam, report it:

**Email**: issues@carnivoreweekly.com
**Subject**: "Spam in Trending Topics"
**Include**: What the topic was, why it's spam

We'll review and refine the filtering algorithm.

### Q: How often do trending topics update?

A: Trending topics update every Monday morning when we publish new content. New data from the past week of videos is analyzed and ranked. So every week, you'll see fresh trending topics.

### Q: Can I filter trending topics by something other than sentiment?

A: Currently you can filter by sentiment (positive/neutral/negative). Other filter options we're considering:

- By time (this week, all-time)
- By category (health, performance, recipes, etc.)
- By video source (which creator discussed it)

Let us know which filters would be most helpful!

## Wiki Auto-Linker Questions

### Q: What are the underlined terms in the content?

A: Those are interactive health and nutrition definitions. When you hover (desktop) or tap (mobile), a popup appears with a quick definition and a "Learn More" link.

### Q: How do I know if a term is linked?

A: Linked terms are:
- Underlined
- Usually a different color
- Change color or appear highlighted when you hover

Not every word in the article is linked—only important health/nutrition terms.

### Q: Can I search for specific terms?

A: Yes, use the search feature in the Wiki section:

1. Go to the homepage
2. Look for the Wiki search box
3. Type a term you want to learn about
4. See all definitions containing that term

### Q: What if I already know what a term means?

A: You don't have to read every definition! They're optional—just for people who want to learn. Skip the ones you know.

### Q: What if a definition is wrong or outdated?

A: Report it! Email us:

**Email**: wiki@carnivoreweekly.com
**Subject**: "Definition Error: [Term Name]"
**Include**:
- The term
- What's wrong with the definition
- What the correct definition should be
- Source/citation if you have one

We review all corrections within 48 hours.

### Q: Can you add a specific term to the wiki?

A: Yes! If you're frequently wondering about a term, we'd love to add it. Email:

**Email**: wiki@carnivoreweekly.com
**Subject**: "Add Term: [Term Name]"
**Include**:
- The term
- Why it's important
- What people should know about it

We add new terms monthly based on community requests.

### Q: How many terms are defined?

A: As of January 2026, we've defined 150+ health and nutrition terms. We add 10-20 new terms monthly based on community questions.

### Q: What categories of terms are covered?

A: Terms are organized by category:

- **Metabolic** - Ketosis, autophagy, metabolic adaptation, etc.
- **Nutrition** - Macronutrients, micronutrients, amino acids, etc.
- **Health** - Bioavailability, inflammation, insulin sensitivity, etc.
- **Lifestyle** - Sleep, stress, exercise, etc.

We're expanding all categories regularly.

## Sentiment Threads Questions

### Q: What exactly is "sentiment"?

A: Sentiment is the emotional tone or perspective of a comment:

- **Positive (Green)**: Enthusiastic, supportive, sharing wins and success stories
- **Neutral (Gray)**: Factual, asking questions, balanced discussions
- **Negative (Red)**: Expressing concerns, sharing challenges, critical perspectives

The system analyzes comment text to categorize the tone.

### Q: How accurate is the sentiment analysis?

A: The system is 80-90% accurate on sentiment classification. Like all AI, it makes occasional mistakes. If you see obvious misclassifications, report them:

**Email**: feedback@carnivoreweekly.com
**Subject**: "Sentiment Error"

We refine the algorithm based on feedback.

### Q: Why would I want to see negative comments?

A: Understanding concerns is crucial for making balanced health decisions. Positive comments show benefits others experienced. Negative comments show challenges. Seeing both helps you:

- Understand real risks
- Know what to watch for
- Prepare for the transition
- Make informed decisions
- Set realistic expectations

### Q: Can I filter sentiment by something else?

A: Currently you filter by sentiment (positive/neutral/negative). Other options we could add:

- Sort by recency (newest first)
- Sort by engagement (most upvoted)
- Filter by topic/keyword
- Filter by video source
- Filter by time period (this week, all-time)

Vote for your preferred filters!

### Q: How is the sentiment data generated?

A: Weekly process:

1. YouTube comments are collected from all featured videos
2. Each comment is analyzed by our sentiment system
3. Comments are categorized as positive, neutral, or negative
4. Data is aggregated and displayed on the homepage

The system runs every Monday when we publish new content.

### Q: Can I see the raw comments?

A: Yes, you can see the discussion snippets in the Sentiment Threads cards. To see the full comment on YouTube, click "View Discussion" and it takes you to the comment on the original video.

### Q: What if I disagree with the sentiment classification?

A: We'd like to know! Email:

**Email**: feedback@carnivoreweekly.com
**Subject**: "Sentiment Classification Issue"
**Include**:
- The comment text (or describe it)
- What sentiment it was labeled as
- What you think it should be
- Why you disagree

Your feedback helps us improve.

- Scientific accuracy

Content goes live Monday morning with the rest of the weekly update.
