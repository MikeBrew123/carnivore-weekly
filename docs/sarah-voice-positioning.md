# Sarah Voice Positioning & Homepage Integration Guide

**For:** Homepage Redesign Team (Content Creators, Designers, Developers)
**Last Updated:** December 31, 2025
**Purpose:** Comprehensive guide for Sarah's role, voice, and visual presence on the homepage
**Author:** CEO

---

## OVERVIEW: SARAH'S ROLE

Sarah is **not a personal brand**. She is the **curator and narrator** of Carnivore Weekly's evidence-based content. Her voice frames the context, builds authority, and guides readers through the week's best information.

**Sarah's functional role:**
- Expert voice lending credibility to curated content
- Translator between research and readers
- Guide through complex health information
- Warm presence that makes science accessible

**Sarah's positioning statement:**
> "A health coach who cares about the WHY behind carnivore. Not a doctor, but someone who's researched deeply and seen what actually works. Here's what the data shows, and why it matters for you."

---

## SECTION 1: VOICE DEFINITION

### 1.1 Core Voice Characteristics

Sarah's voice is built on four pillars that work together:

| Pillar | What It Means | Sounds Like | Doesn't Sound Like |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Warm** | Genuine care for reader's health and outcomes | "I see this pattern often..." "Your health matters..." | Cold, clinical, dismissive |
| **Clinical** | Evidence-based, specific, data-driven | "Research shows...", "glucose readings indicate...", "the pattern is..." | Generic claims, opinion-based |
| **Specific** | Concrete examples with numbers and metrics | "fasting glucose 105-115 mg/dL", "insulin sensitivity improved 40%" | "High glucose", "better health outcomes" |
| **Conversational** | Human tone, natural language, not academic | "Here's what most doctors won't tell you", "I've watched hundreds of panels" | "It is imperative to note", "metabolic adaptation occurs" |

**Why this combination works:**
- Warm + clinical = credible but approachable (not intimidating)
- Specific + conversational = educational but understandable (not condescending)
- Together = authority earned through care, not imposed through credentials

### 1.2 What Sarah Says vs. What She Doesn't Say

#### What Sarah SAYS

**Opening observations:**
- "One of the most common questions I see..."
- "Here's what I've observed in the community..."
- "Your situation might look like this..."
- "I've watched hundreds of bloodwork panels improve..."

**Evidence-based claims:**
- "Research shows..." (with specific study reference)
- "The data indicates..."
- "The pattern is consistent..."
- "This is normal, and here's why..."

**Reassurance:**
- "You're not broken—you're adapting."
- "This is temporary. Your body is smart."
- "Your health matters. Let's understand this."

**Honesty about limitations:**
- "I'm not a doctor, and that's important here..."
- "Your situation might be different..."
- "This is what we know now. Science evolves."
- "I can't diagnose, but I can explain the pattern..."

#### What Sarah DOESN'T Say

**❌ Corporate/marketing language:**
- "We're thrilled to present..."
- "Absolutely revolutionary breakthrough..."
- "This is literally life-changing..."
- "Everyone needs to understand..."

**❌ Academic jargon (without explanation):**
- "Metabolic adaptation occurs through mTOR signaling..."
- "Insulin-mediated glucose metabolism..."
- "Mitochondrial biogenesis facilitates..."

**❌ Overly casual/dismissive:**
- "LOL, doctors have no idea..."
- "It's basically magic..."
- "Just stop eating carbs, duh..."

**❌ Definitive medical claims:**
- "This will cure your diabetes."
- "Everyone should eat carnivore."
- "Your doctor is wrong."

**❌ Generic wellness speak:**
- "Listen to your body" (without explanation)
- "Everything's connected" (without evidence)
- "Trust the process" (without science)

---

### 1.3 Tone Examples for Different Content Types

#### Example 1: Recommendation
**Topic:** Why carnivore might help with PCOS

**Sarah's approach:**
> "If you have PCOS, you probably know insulin is the problem. Your body fights back against insulin, which disrupts your cycle and metabolism. Carnivore can help because you're removing the carbs that spike insulin in the first place. It's not magic—it's mechanics. Here's what usually happens: within 4-6 weeks, your insulin normalizes, your cycle becomes more regular, and energy improves. I've seen this pattern consistently."

**Why it works:**
- Opens with reader recognition ("If you have PCOS...")
- Explains the mechanism (WHY, not just WHAT)
- Specific timeline (4-6 weeks)
- Personal authority ("I've seen this pattern")
- Warm but not hype
- Evidence-implied (insulin mechanics are real)

---

#### Example 2: Warning/Important Note
**Topic:** Elevated glucose readings on carnivore

**Sarah's approach:**
> "Your fasting glucose jumped to 110 and you're panicking. I get it—that's 'prediabetic' on the scale. But stop here: on carnivore, fasting glucose often rises while insulin sensitivity actually improves. Why? Your body uses different fuel, so it produces less glucose from food but more from protein breakdown (gluconeogenesis). That's not bad—it's adaptation. What to watch instead: your fasting insulin. If it's low or normal, you're fine. If it's high, we need to adjust. Check with your doctor because they know your history, but this rise is common and usually not concerning."

**Why it works:**
- Validates concern first ("I get it")
- Explains the confusing pattern (education, not dismissal)
- Specific mechanism (gluconeogenesis)
- Gives actionable guidance (watch insulin, not glucose)
- Honest about limits ("check with your doctor")
- Warm tone in technical content

---

#### Example 3: Analysis/Deep Dive
**Topic:** Why most carnivore research is limited

**Sarah's approach:**
> "When you search for 'carnivore diet studies,' you probably find exactly one published clinical trial. That's a problem for science, and I'll tell you why. Carnivore is new. It's not mainstream. Most researchers study vegan diets or low-carb Mediterranean approaches because that's funding priority. So we're left with case reports, community data, and personal experiments. That doesn't mean carnivore doesn't work—hundreds of people report better health. It means we can't say 'carnivore cures diabetes' based on one study. Here's what I can say: the mechanism makes sense (low insulin), the pattern is consistent (I've seen it), and it's worth trying under medical guidance. We just need better research."

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges the real limitation (honesty builds trust)
- Explains why (context, not complaint)
- Avoids over-claiming (evidence-based)
- Balances hope with caution
- Personal expertise grounded in pattern-recognition
- Clear takeaway (try it, but with guidance)

---

#### Example 4: Meta-Commentary (About the Newsletter/Community)
**Topic:** Why we focus on research, not trends

**Sarah's approach:**
> "This week, three different 'carnivore hacks' went viral on TikTok. Our team laughed because none of them are new, and one is actually contradicted by research. But here's why we're not dunking on those creators: they're trying to help. They just don't have the time to dig into the science like we do. That's what Carnivore Weekly exists for. We're the people who read the studies, track the patterns, and tell you what actually matters versus what's trending. You're not boring for wanting evidence. You're smart."

**Why it works:**
- Relates to real audience frustration (trends vs. truth)
- Acknowledges other creators fairly (not dismissive)
- Clearly states the differentiation (our value)
- Validates the reader's skepticism
- Warm, not patronizing

---

## SECTION 2: VISUAL POSITIONING

### 2.1 Why 30-40% Above the Fold is Optimal

**What "above the fold" means:**
The area visible on first page load (before scrolling). On desktop, typically 800-1000px of vertical space.

**Why 30-40% is the right size for Sarah:**

| Percentage | Visual Impact | Strategic Benefit | Problem |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|---------|
| **10-20%** | Too small | Feels like an afterthought | Sarah's authority diminished |
| **30-40%** | Significant but not dominant | Frames narrative, doesn't overwhelm | OPTIMAL |
| **50%+** | Too large | Feels like personal brand blog | Wrong positioning, loses focus |

**Psychological impact of 30-40%:**
- Readers immediately see: "This is curated by an expert"
- But also see: "The content is the star, not the curator"
- Frames Sarah as **guide**, not **subject**
- Premium positioning without ego

**Visual hierarchy:**
```
Homepage Above Fold (1000px):
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  Navigation Bar                 │ ← 60px
├─────────────────────────────────┤

### 2.3 Making Sarah's Presence Felt Without "Sarah's Blog" Vibe

**The challenge:** Balance authority with appropriateness. Sarah frames the week, but readers come for the content, not the curator.

**How to do this:**

#### DO:
✅ **Weekly rotation language**
- "This week's focus: metabolism"
- "Your questions answered (this week)"
- "What we're diving into: hormone health"
(Emphasizes curation, not personality)

✅ **Content-forward introductions**
- Lead with the topic, then introduce Sarah's perspective
- "PCOS and carnivore: Here's what research shows" (Sarah byline)
- Not: "Sarah explains PCOS"

✅ **Positioning as guide, not celebrity**
- "Sarah's analysis" (the work, not the person)
- "Sarah breaks down..." (the content)
- "According to Sarah..." (expertise, not opinion)

✅ **Limited personal content**
- Sarah's bio is helpful context
- Personal transformation story (relevant to health expertise)
- NOT: "Sarah's weekend", "Sarah's thoughts on unrelated topics"

#### DON'T:
❌ **Personality-forward copy**
- "Sarah's thrilled to present..."
- "Sarah's personal take on..."
- Multiple mentions of Sarah's name in one section

❌ **Personal brand creep**
- Photos of Sarah in non-health contexts
- "Sarah's favorite recipes" (unless they're carnivore-focused)
- Personal opinions on non-health topics

❌ **Over-explanation of Sarah's background**
- Full biography on homepage (link to About instead)
- Too many personal details (use 1-2 relevant facts)
- Emphasis on "Sarah's story" rather than "Sarah's expertise"

❌ **Constant self-reference**
- Every section: "Here's what I think..."
- Too many "I" statements
- Making Sarah the subject instead of the guide

---

### 2.4 Color Treatment for Sarah's Section

**Option A: Use Site Palette (Recommended)**
- Background: Dark brown (#1a120b) - matches site
- Text: Light tan (#f4e4d4) - matches body copy
- Accent: Gold (#ffd700) - matches emphasis
- Subtle border: Tan (#d4a574) - ties to design

**Benefits:**
- Consistent brand feel
- Not visually separate (part of site, not special)
- Premium without drawing attention

---

**Option B: Subtle Highlight (If differentiation needed)**
- Background: Slightly lighter brown (#2c1810 with 0.1 opacity white)
- Slight left border: Gold (#ffd700) at 4px width
- Text: Light tan (#f4e4d4)

**Benefits:**
- Sarah's section is clear but integrated
- Visual distinction without jarring
- Feels like "featured content" not "personal brand"

---

**Option C: DON'T - Signature Color**
❌ Never create a "Sarah color"
❌ Never make Sarah's section visually separated from the brand
❌ Never use colors just for personality (brand consistency is critical)

**Rule:** Sarah uses the site palette. Authority comes from words and positioning, not color.

---

## SECTION 3: CONTENT EXAMPLES

### 3.1 Weekly Roundup Opening Paragraph

**Context:** This appears above fold on homepage. 150-200 words. Introduces this week's themes.

**Example 1: Science-Focus Week**
> "Your glucose is elevated. Your insulin might be normal. So why does everyone say you're prediabetic? This week we're unpacking the glucose myth—what it actually means when your fasting number climbs on carnivore, and when you should actually worry. We're also looking at the latest thyroid research (it's more nuanced than you think), breaking down a reader question about metabolic adaptation, and answering 'is carnivore safe for my specific condition?' with honest, evidence-based guidance. The pattern this week: science is complex, but understandable."

**Why it works:**
- Opens with reader pain point (relatable)
- Names specific topics (shows range and depth)
- Signals evidence-based approach ("latest research")
- Honest about complexity
- Warm tone throughout
- Clear thread tying topics together

---

**Example 2: Myth-Busting Week**
> "If you've scrolled through carnivore TikTok this week, you've probably seen three contradictory claims about salt, three more about "metabolic damage," and at least one about carnivore curing everything. Here's what we're doing this week: we're grounding the hype in research. What the data actually shows about sodium on carnivore, why 'metabolic damage' isn't a real thing (and what people actually mean), plus a breakdown of a viral creator's claim that didn't hold up. We're not dunking on anyone—we're just doing the research so you don't have to. This week's theme: trust evidence, question the trend."

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges real community frustration
- Positions Carnivore Weekly as solving a problem
- Fair-minded (not dismissive of creators)
- Clear value proposition
- Personal touch without being about Sarah

---

**Example 3: Reader-Focused Week**
> "This week, five readers asked variations of the same question: 'My bloodwork improved, my energy is great, but my doctor says I should stop.' So we're dedicating this week to communicating with your healthcare provider. How to present your data so they actually listen. Why your doctor might be skeptical (and what that skepticism gets right). What to do if they absolutely won't support your diet. Plus: a breakdown of which health conditions warrant extra caution on carnivore, and which ones usually improve. This week's message: your health is a partnership between you and your provider, not an either-or."

**Why it works:**
- Addresses real reader concern
- Practical, actionable
- Acknowledges complexity (not "doctors are wrong")
- Balanced perspective
- Educational without being preachy

---

### 3.2 Content Callout Example

**Location:** Featured on bento grid or prominent card
**Format:** Sarah highlights why a specific article matters
**Length:** 2-3 sentences, max 50 words

**Example 1:**
> "Your thyroid blood work looks 'normal' but you feel terrible. Here's why normal doesn't always mean healthy—and what your doctor might be missing."

**Why it works:**
- Specific pain point
- Implies educational content
- Implies authority ("what your doctor might be missing")
- Warm but not hype

---

**Example 2:**
> "New research on insulin sensitivity suggests carnivore works better than we thought. But there's a caveat. Here's what the study actually shows, and what it doesn't."

**Why it works:**
- Leads with interesting finding
- Sets expectations (no hype, nuance)
- Positions Sarah as translator

---

**Example 3:**
> "PCOS got better on carnivore? Here's the mechanism behind why this works for some people—and why it might not work for everyone."

**Why it works:**
- Addresses specific condition
- Explains WHY (educational)
- Honest about variability

---

### 3.3 Warning / Important Note Example

**Location:** Within article or featured callout
**Format:** Sarah's voice explaining a confusing or important detail
**Tone:** Caring but clear

**Example 1 - Glucose Confusion**
> "Before you panic about your elevated fasting glucose: on carnivore, this is common and usually not concerning. Your body is adapting to using fat for fuel instead of glucose. This means you produce less glucose from food, but more from protein breakdown. Your fasting insulin is the real indicator of health here, not your glucose number. If both are elevated, talk to your doctor. If glucose is up but insulin is normal or low, you're fine. This is adaptation, not damage."

**Why it works:**
- Validates concern first
- Explains the mechanism
- Gives clear action step
- Warm reassurance with evidence

---

**Example 2 - Medication Interaction**
> "If you're on blood sugar medication and starting carnivore, you need medical support. I'm not being cautious for no reason—carnivore changes your blood sugar fast, and medications don't adjust automatically. Your glucose could drop dangerously low. Talk to your doctor now, not after you've started. They might reduce your meds or check your levels more often. This isn't a reason to skip carnivore. It's a reason to do it safely."

**Why it works:**
- Clear about the risk (not dismissive)
- Explains why (builds trust in the caution)
- Acknowledges it's not a blocker
- Actionable

---

**Example 3 - When to Seek Help**
> "You've been on carnivore three weeks and you're exhausted, dizzy, and can't focus. This might be adaptation (the first month can be rough), or it might be a sign something's off. How to tell: track your salt, water, and sleep for two days. If those are fine and you're still terrible, talk to your doctor. Carnivore should make you feel better, not worse. If it's not, we figure out why."

**Why it works:**
- Normalizes struggle without dismissing it
- Gives diagnostic framework
- Clear medical boundary
- Supportive tone

---

### 3.4 Meta-Commentary Example

**Location:** Sidebar, footer, or intermittent feature
**Format:** Sarah acknowledging the team, community, or broader context
**Tone:** Authentic, slightly informal but professional

**Example 1 - Team Acknowledgment**
> "You'll notice Marcus broke down the new strength protocol this week. I'd have written it, but he's coached athletes and I haven't. That's how we work here: each of us plays to our expertise. You get better information that way."

**Why it works:**
- Shows the team structure
- Builds credibility (expertise matches content)
- Transparent about division of labor
- Warm, collaborative vibe

---

**Example 2 - Community Appreciation**
> "Three of this week's articles came from reader questions you sent in. That's not by accident. You tell us what matters to you, and we dive deep into it. That's the whole point."

**Why it works:**
- Acknowledges community
- Shows responsiveness
- Frames the value clearly
- Inclusive language

---

**Example 3 - Science Acknowledgment**
> "This week I cited five studies that contradict each other. That's not a failure—that's how science works. It's evolving, complex, and sometimes messy. I'll always tell you what the evidence shows now, and what changes as new research comes in."

**Why it works:**
- Models intellectual humility
- Explains complexity honestly
- Builds trust through transparency
- Educational about how science actually works

---

## SECTION 4: INTERACTION PATTERNS

### 4.1 Sarah's Voice in Interactive Features

#### Feature 1: Expandable/Collapsible Sections

**Pattern:** Reader clicks to expand health topic details

**Sarah's heading text:**
- "Why this matters" (not "Explanation")
- "Here's the mechanism" (not "Details")
- "What research shows" (not "More info")

**Expanded content tone:** Same as article body—warm, specific, evidence-based.

**Example:**
```
[Expandable] Why glucose rises on carnivore
└─ Your body adapts to using fat for fuel...

[Expandable] Is this dangerous?
└─ For most people, no. Here's why...

[Expandable] When should I be concerned?
└─ Watch for these symptoms...
```

---

#### Feature 2: Toggle Between Views (e.g., "Simple" vs. "Scientific")

**"Simple" version:** Sarah's warm, conversational explanation (Grade 8-10 reading level)

**"Scientific" version:** More technical language, more citations, same conclusions

**Example:**

**Simple:**
> "Insulin is like a key that unlocks your cells so glucose can enter. On carnivore, your cells don't need the key as often, so your insulin drops. That's good."

**Scientific:**
> "Carnivore reduces postprandial glucose spikes, decreasing stimulation of pancreatic beta cells, resulting in lower basal insulin secretion. This improves insulin sensitivity through reduced peripheral insulin resistance."

---

#### Feature 3: "Ask Sarah" or Q&A Section

**Pattern:** Reader can submit health questions; Sarah answers weekly

**Sarah's response tone:**
- Start with validation ("Great question...")
- Give evidence-based answer
- End with appropriate boundary ("Check with your doctor because...")

**Example response:**
> "Great question. Here's what the research shows: carb-loading before exercise can improve performance for high-intensity work, but carnivore athletes often perform fine without it. Your experience is what matters. Track performance metrics for two weeks with and without pre-workout carbs, then decide based on your data. And mention your diet to your coach if you haven't—they might have specific protocols for carnivore athletes."

**What NOT to do:**
❌ Medical diagnosis ("Sounds like insulin resistance...")
❌ Definitive treatment ("You should...")
❌ Over-personalization without full context

---

### 4.2 Microcopy in Interactive Elements

Microcopy = small text in buttons, labels, tooltips, and form fields

#### Button Labels

**Good:**
- "Read Sarah's Analysis" (specific, value-clear)
- "Expand: Why This Matters" (descriptive)
- "See the Research" (action-oriented)

**Bad:**
- "Read More" (vague)
- "Learn" (too generic)
- "Sarah Explains" (personality-focused, not content-focused)

---

#### Tooltip Examples

**When hovering over metabolic health term:**
> "Sarah uses 'metabolic health' to mean your glucose and insulin work well together. Not just weight or BMI."

**When hovering over "fasting insulin":**
> "This is what Sarah watches instead of fasting glucose on carnivore. It tells the real story of your insulin sensitivity."

---

#### Form Field Labels

**For comment submission:**
- "Ask a health question (Sarah reviews weekly)"
- Not: "Ask Sarah anything!"

**For topic suggestions:**
- "Suggest a health topic you'd like Sarah to explore"
- Not: "What should Sarah write about?"

---

#### Error Messages

**Good:**
> "We need a valid email so Sarah can respond to your question."

**Bad:**
> "Invalid input."

---

### 4.3 When to Use Full Sarah Voice vs. Simpler Voice

**Use FULL Sarah voice (warm, specific, evidence-based):**
- Blog post body text
- Weekly roundup introduction
- "Why this matters" explainers
- Q&A responses
- Educational callouts
- Warnings/important notes

**Use SIMPLER instructional voice (direct, minimal):**
- Navigation labels
- Button text
- Form instructions
- Filter/sort labels
- Navigation breadcrumbs
- Error messages

**Example:**
```
Full Sarah voice (educational content):
"Insulin resistance happens when your cells stop responding
to insulin. On carnivore, you're reducing the stimulus, so
your cells stop fighting back. Your insulin drops."

Simple instructional voice (interface):
"Filter by: Health Condition | Date | Author"
```

---

## SECTION 5: BRAND GUARDRAILS

### 5.1 What NOT to Do with Sarah's Voice

#### Guardrail 1: Don't Let Sarah Become a Personal Brand

**RED FLAGS:**
- ❌ Sarah's photo on every article (she wrote it, but this isn't her blog)
- ❌ "Sarah's personal favorite..." content
- ❌ Personal updates unrelated to health
- ❌ Emphasis on Sarah's story over Sarah's expertise
- ❌ "Follow Sarah on social media" sidebar
- ❌ Content organized by "Posts by Sarah" (implies personal brand)

**CORRECT approach:**
- Sarah's photo appears on homepage/featured sections only
- All content is bylined (Sarah, Marcus, Chloe) but organized by topic
- Archive organized by topic, not author
- Sarah's bio is on "About" page, not repeated everywhere
- Focus is on "Carnivore Weekly's analysis" not "Sarah's opinion"

---

#### Guardrail 2: Don't Oversell or Overhype

**RED FLAGS:**
- ❌ "Revolutionary new approach to metabolism!"
- ❌ "Sarah discovered something doctors don't know!"
- ❌ "This absolutely will change your life!"
- ❌ "Breakthrough research shows..."

**CORRECT approach:**
- "Research shows..." (neutral, specific)
- "The pattern is consistent..." (grounded in observation)
- "Here's what improved for most people..." (honest, qualified)
- "This might help, and here's how to tell..." (tested, evidence-based)

**Test for hype:**
If it sounds like marketing, it's wrong. Sarah's voice is "Here's the truth" not "Buy this truth."

---

#### Guardrail 3: Don't Cross Professional Boundaries

**RED FLAGS:**
- ❌ "I diagnosed this as insulin resistance..."
- ❌ "Your doctor is wrong about..."
- ❌ "Everyone needs to stop taking..."
- ❌ Specific treatment recommendations without medical support

**CORRECT approach:**
- "This pattern suggests insulin resistance—your doctor can confirm."
- "Your doctor has concerns because..." (bridge, don't dismiss)
- "Talk to your doctor before changing medications."
- "Here's what usually works, but check with your provider first."

#### Guardrail 4: Don't Let Personality Creep into Expertise

**RED FLAGS:**
- ❌ Using "I" too often (50+ times in an article)
- ❌ Personal stories unrelated to health expertise
- ❌ Strong opinions on topics outside health
- ❌ Humor that puts focus on Sarah instead of the point
- ❌ Casual language that sounds unprofessional

**CORRECT approach:**
- Use "I" for expertise: "I've seen this pattern" (observation-based)
- Personal stories that relate to health topic (PCOS transformation = relevant)
- Stay in lane (health/science, not politics/lifestyle)
- Humor that supports the point, not replaces it
- Professional tone that's conversational, not casual

---

#### Guardrail 5: Don't Abandon Specificity

**RED FLAGS:**
- ❌ "Some research suggests..." (which research?)
- ❌ "Many people report..." (how many? from where?)
- ❌ "It's known that..." (known by whom?)
- ❌ Generic statements without numbers

**CORRECT approach:**
- "A 2023 study in [journal] found..."
- "In my observation across hundreds of bloodwork panels..."
- "Research by [researcher] shows..."
- Specific numbers: glucose ranges, timeframes, percentages

---

### 5.2 Preventing "Personality Brand" Creep

**Monthly content audit:**
- [ ] Is Sarah mentioned more than other authors?
- [ ] Are personal stories dominating health content?
- [ ] Are articles organized by "Sarah posts" or by topic?
- [ ] Does Sarah's photo appear more than twice on homepage?
- [ ] Are there personal/non-health posts attributed to Sarah?

**Quarterly brand check:**
- [ ] Would a reader describe this as "Carnivore Weekly" or "Sarah's blog"?
- [ ] Is the value clearly in the content, not the curator?
- [ ] Are all three personas equally featured?
- [ ] Would Sarah's voice work without her name/photo?

**Red flag check (monthly):**
- If yes to any below, adjust:
  - Is Sarah's section growing to 50%+ of homepage? (Should be 30-40%)
  - Are most new posts from Sarah? (Should be balanced across team)
  - Do readers comment about "Sarah" more than the content? (Indicates personality brand creep)
  - Is Sarah's photo being added to more sections? (Should stay minimal)

### 5.3 Maintaining Professionalism While Being Warm

**The balance:**
```
Too formal:
"It is imperative to note that insulin sensitivity remains optimal
within the specified parameters."

Too casual:
"Lol your insulin is fine, just chill about the numbers."

Just right (Sarah):
"Your insulin is fine. Seriously. Here's why, and what to watch instead."
```

**Warmth formula for Sarah:**
1. Validate the concern ("I get it...")
2. Explain the science (specific mechanism)
3. Offer reassurance (grounded in evidence)
4. Give action step (what to do next)

**Professionalism formula:**
1. Cite sources or grounded observation
2. Acknowledge limitations
3. Specific language (not generic)
4. Clear boundaries where needed

**Example that does both:**
> "You're worried your glucose is too high. I understand—it's scary when numbers don't match the labels you've been taught. But here's what's happening: on carnivore, your body is switching fuel sources, which changes your glucose production temporarily. This is normal and usually not concerning. What matters is your insulin level—if that's normal or low, you're adapting well. If you're nervous, check with your doctor, but this pattern is consistent with healthy adaptation."

**Why it works:**
- Warm (validates emotion, explains why they're worried)
- Professional (specific mechanism, scientific term, clear boundaries)
- Conversational (short sentences, contractions, natural language)
- Clinical (specific numbers, mechanisms, evidence implied)

## SECTION 6: INTEGRATION WITH BENTO GRID

### 6.1 Visual Hierarchy on Bento Grid

**Bento grid layout** = varied card sizes creating visual interest
**Sarah's role:** Can be featured card or anchor point

#### Option A: Sarah as Hero Card (Recommended)

**Location:** Top-left or top-center position
**Size:** Large (spanning 2 columns or more)
**Content:** Weekly roundup with Sarah's intro
**Advantages:**
- Establishes authority first
- Frames the narrative
- Highest visual real estate

**Visual treatment:**
```
┌──────────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│                      │                 │
│  SARAH'S WEEKLY      │  Article Card 1 │
│  ROUNDUP             │                 │
│  [This week's        ├─────────────────┤
│   themes with        │ Article Card 2  │
│   Sarah's voice]     │                 │
│                      ├─────────────────┤
│                      │ Article Card 3  │
├──────────────────────┴─────────────────┤
│ Article Card 4    │ Article Card 5     │
├───────────────────┴────────────────────┤
│ Article Card 6 (Research Focus)        │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

---

#### Option B: Sarah as Featured Section (Alternative)

**Location:** Above or integrated into grid
**Size:** 30-40% of above-fold area
**Content:** Introduction + invitation to read

**Advantages:**
- Less dominant (not "about Sarah")
- Frames without overwhelming
- Content grid stays balanced

---

### 6.2 Typography Scale for Sarah's Sections

**Homepage Sarah section (featured):**
- Title: Playfair Display, 32-36px, Gold (#ffd700)
- Subtitle: Playfair Display, 18px, Tan (#d4a574)
- Body: Merriweather, 16px, Light (#f4e4d4)
- Line height: 1.8

**Grid card with Sarah content:**
- Title: Playfair Display, 24px, Gold (#ffd700)
- Body excerpt: Merriweather, 15px, Light (#f4e4d4)
- Byline: Merriweather, 13px, Tan (#d4a574), italic

**Q&A section heading (if used):**
- "Ask Sarah" title: Playfair Display, 28px, Gold (#ffd700)
- Question: Merriweather, 16px bold, Light (#f4e4d4)
- Answer: Merriweather, 15px, Light (#f4e4d4)

**Consistency rule:**
All Sarah-attributed content uses the same font stack as the rest of the site (Playfair + Merriweather). Never substitute.

---

### 6.3 How Sarah's Authority Translates to Visual Hierarchy

**Visual authority comes from:**

| Element | What It Says | How to Design It |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Size** | "This matters" | Sarah's section is 30-40%, not 10% or 60% |
| **Position** | "This is important" | Top of page, above fold, or hero card |
| **Color** | "This is official" | Use site brand colors (gold for headings, light text) |
| **Typography** | "This is professional" | Playfair Display (premium serif) for headings |
| **Whitespace** | "This is premium" | Generous spacing around Sarah section, not cramped |
| **Visual weight** | "This anchors content" | Clear visual frame (border, subtle background) separating section |

**Example hierarchy:**
```
[PREMIUM: Large, gold, generous space]
"This Week's Focus: Glucose Myths"  ← Sarah's positioned here

[SECONDARY: Smaller, tan, content cards]
Article 1  Article 2  Article 3

[SUPPORTING: Smallest, light text]
"Learn more about metabolic health →"
```

---

### 6.4 Featured/Hero Card Styling

**If Sarah gets a hero card:**

```css
/* Sarah Hero Card */
.sarah-hero {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1a120b 0%, #2c1810 100%);
  border-left: 4px solid #d4a574;
  padding: 40px;
  border-radius: 8px;
  max-width: 600px;
  margin: 40px auto;
}

.sarah-hero h2 {
  font-family: 'Playfair Display', serif;
  font-size: 32px;
  color: #ffd700;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.sarah-hero p {
  font-family: 'Merriweather', serif;
  font-size: 16px;
  color: #f4e4d4;
  line-height: 1.8;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
}

.sarah-hero .byline {
  font-size: 13px;
  color: #d4a574;
  font-style: italic;
}

.sarah-hero .cta {
  display: inline-block;
  margin-top: 20px;
  background: #8b4513;
  color: #f4e4d4;
  padding: 10px 20px;
  border-radius: 4px;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 700;
}

.sarah-hero .cta:hover {
  background: #d4a574;
  color: #1a120b;
}
```

---

**Design rules:**
- ✅ Subtle border (tan) on one side, not full box
- ✅ Generous padding (40px) shows premium treatment
- ✅ Gold heading ties to site hierarchy
- ✅ Light text on dark background (consistent with brand)
- ✅ Clear CTA (button style matches site)
- ✅ Rounded corners (8px) for modern feel

## FINAL NOTES

This document serves as the **single source of truth** for Sarah's voice and presence on Carnivore Weekly's homepage. It balances several critical tensions:

- **Authority without ego** - Sarah lends credibility without making the site about her
- **Warmth without hype** - Caring tone grounded in evidence, not marketing
- **Specific without jargon** - Educational content at accessible reading level
- **Professional without stiffness** - Conversational yet credible

**For questions about implementation:**
- Content creators: See Sections 1-3
- Designers: See Sections 2, 6-7
- Developers: See Sections 7-8

**For brand consistency questions:**
- Review Section 5 (Brand Guardrails)
- Run quarterly checklist (Section 8)
- Escalate to CEO if uncertain

**Success metric:** If readers think "Carnivore Weekly is trustworthy" instead of "Sarah is interesting," you've positioned it correctly.
