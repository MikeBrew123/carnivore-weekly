- Click a comment to visit the original YouTube video context
- Sort by: Most recent, Most engaged, Most relevant

## Bento Grid Layout

### What It Is

The Bento Grid Layout is a responsive, premium editorial design system that reorganizes the homepage from a traditional linear stack into a sophisticated multi-size grid layout. Named after the Japanese food arrangement style, the Bento Grid strategically places content in varying sizes to emphasize important information and increase content visibility above the fold.

**Purpose**: Display more meaningful content above the fold while maintaining a premium, editorial aesthetic.

### Design Principles

- **Content Hierarchy**: Larger cells for hero/featured content, smaller cells for supporting content
- **Editorial Premium**: Maintains Carnivore Weekly's sophisticated, leather-textured aesthetic
- **Responsive Flow**: Seamlessly adapts across desktop (3-col), tablet (2-col), and mobile (1-col)

- **Secondary Content** (right): Occupies 1 column × 2 rows (30% of above-fold space)
- **Supporting Content** (bottom): Occupies 3 columns (30% of above-fold space)
- **Result**: 5-7 content items visible above fold
- **Interactions**: Hover cards lift with shadow, click to read more

#### Tablet Experience (768px - 1099px)
- **Hero Section**: Full width, single row (2 columns, 1 row)
- **Secondary Content**: 2 columns, flowing below hero
- **Supporting Content**: Flows in 2-column rows below secondary
- **Result**: 4-5 content items visible above fold
- **Touch Friendly**: Larger touch targets, spacing optimized for fingers
