====================================================
HOW TO USE THESE ARTIFACTS
====================================================

FOR QUICK OVERVIEW (5 minutes):
1. Read this file (VALIDATION_ARTIFACTS_INDEX.txt)
2. Read /Users/mbrew/Developer/carnivore-weekly/CASEY_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md
3. Review the 3 screenshots to see visual quality

FOR COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING (30 minutes):
1. Read CASEY_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md (primary report)
2. Read VISUAL_VALIDATION_REPORT.md (detailed visual analysis)
3. Read FORM_SPECIFICATION_COMPARISON.md (field comparison)
4. Read VALIDATION_ACTION_REQUIRED.md (action steps)

FOR LEADERSHIP DECISION:
1. Share CASEY_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md (executive summary)
2. Highlight "Decision & Recommendation" section
3. Present two options (keep current vs rebuild)
4. Request specification decision

FOR DEVELOPMENT:
1. Read FORM_SPECIFICATION_COMPARISON.md (detailed spec)
2. Note all 14 missing fields
3. Identify 2 field types to change
4. If rebuilding: use comparison doc as spec
5. If keeping: only add email required attribute

FOR VALIDATION FOLLOW-UP:
1. Get specification decision from CEO/Product
2. If keeping form: Add email required attribute
3. If rebuilding: Use comparison doc to rebuild
4. Run validation again on updated form
5. Proceed to Step 5 when complete

====================================================
CONTACTS & ESCALATION
====================================================

Validation Questions:
→ Jordan (handles overall form validation)

Specification Decision (Critical):
→ CEO / Product Manager
  (Must decide: keep 20-field form OR rebuild to 22-field spec)

Operational Coordination:
→ Quinn (operations manager)

Next Steps:
1. Share validation report with Jordan
2. Escalate specification decision to CEO
3. Get decision (keep vs rebuild)
4. Either add email required OR rebuild form
5. Revalidate and proceed to Step 5

====================================================
KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
====================================================

WHAT'S PERFECT ✅:
- Visual design (colors, fonts, spacing)
- Responsive behavior (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Brand compliance (all hex values exact)
- Accessibility (WCAG AA standards)
- Touch targets (44px+ minimum)
- Semantic HTML structure

WHAT'S BROKEN ❌:
- Form structure (20 fields vs 22-field spec)
- Field completeness (14 fields missing)
- Email required attribute (missing)
- Field types (2 dropdowns implemented as radio buttons)
- Step organization (doesn't match 4-step spec)

DECISION NEEDED:
Before Step 5 can proceed, clarify:
→ Keep current 20-field form (update spec, 5 min work)
→ OR rebuild to match 22-field spec (2-3 hours work)

BLOCKING ISSUES:
1. Email field missing required attribute
2. 14 fields missing from specification
3. Form structure doesn't match specification

NEXT ACTION:
Escalate specification decision to CEO/Product level
