## 🚀 YOUR FRAMEWORK (Simplified)

Before writing anything, ask:

### **"Does this solve a problem?"**
- YES → Write it
- NO → Rethink or skip

### **"Will someone return to this?"**
- YES → High priority
- NO → Low priority

### **"Am I adding to what exists?"**
- YES → Create it
- NO → Check if it's a duplicate

### **"Does it fit one of these?"**
- 🛠️ **Tool/Interactive** (like Calculator)
- 📚 **Educational/Reference** (like Wiki)
- 📺 **Curated Resources** (like Channels)

If YES → Likely to perform
If NO → Likely to underperform

---

## 📈 SUCCESS METRICS FOR YOUR CONTENT

**New content succeeds if:**
- ✅ Gets 100+ views in first week
- ✅ Reaches 150+ by week 2
- ✅ Gets linked/shared by week 3

**If your content underperforms:**
- Check: Did you link to top pages?
- Check: Is it truly problem-solving?
- Check: Does it duplicate existing content?
- Check: Is it evergreen or time-sensitive?

## 📞 QUESTIONS?

**"What should I write about?"**
→ Check the dashboard and content performance report. Follow the data.

**"How do I know if it's good?"**
→ Use the framework: Does it solve a problem? Will they return to it?

**"I have a different idea..."**
→ Run it through the framework first. If it doesn't solve a problem or add value, it will underperform.

**"Can I write opinion pieces?"**
→ They historically underperform. Better to frame as educational/problem-solving.
