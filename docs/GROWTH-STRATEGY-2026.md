{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "FAQPage",
  "mainEntity": [
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "How long does carnivore adaptation take?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Most people adapt within 2-4 weeks, but symptoms can last 6-8 weeks for some. Common timeline: Week 1-2 (hardest), Week 3-4 (turning point), Week 6+ (full adaptation)."
      }
    },
    {
      "@type": "Question",
      "name": "What causes night sweats on carnivore?",
      "acceptedAnswer": {
        "@type": "Answer",
        "text": "Night sweats are typically caused by: 1) Fat adaptation (your body learning to burn fat), 2) Detox symptoms, 3) Electrolyte imbalances. Usually resolves by week 3-4."

- r/zerocarb (80k+ members)
- r/carnivorediet (20k+ members)
- r/animalbaseddiet (15k+ members)
- r/meatogains (muscle gain focus)

**Daily Routine (30 min/day):**

1. **Morning Scan (10 min)**
   - Sort by "Hot" and "Rising"
   - Identify posts where you can add value
   - Look for: questions, struggles, debates, transformations

2. **Contribute Genuinely (15 min)**
   - Answer 3-5 questions with detailed responses
   - Don't link immediately
   - Build credibility first
   - Example:
     ```
     Great question about electrolytes. Here's what worked for me:

     1. Salt your food liberally (don't fear it)
     2. Drink bone broth if you get headaches
     3. Track symptoms for 2 weeks to see patterns

     Most people need more salt than they think during adaptation.
     Your body is dumping water as it shifts to fat burning.

     If you want a detailed breakdown of electrolyte timing, we covered
     this in depth here: [link to blog post]
     ```

3. **Strategic Linking (5 min)**
   - Only link when directly relevant

     Great breakdown of adaptation symptoms. One thing I'd add for
     beginners: electrolytes make a HUGE difference in week 2-3.
     We tracked this across 100+ community stories and salt intake
     was the #1 factor in easier transitions.

The carnivore diet can cause adaptation symptoms in the first few weeks.
These symptoms include fatigue, headaches, and digestive changes. Most
people find that these symptoms resolve within 2-4 weeks as the body
adapts to using fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates.
```

**After:**
```markdown
**Adaptation symptoms are normal and temporary.**

Common symptoms (first 2-4 weeks):
- Fatigue
- Headaches
- Digestive changes

**Why it happens:** Your body is learning to burn fat instead of carbs.

**How long:** Most people feel better by week 3-4.
```

**Formatting Rules:**

1. **Short Paragraphs**
   - Max 3-4 sentences
   - One idea per paragraph
   - White space between paragraphs

   - Max 5-7 bullets per list

3. **Bold Key Phrases**

5. **Visual Hierarchy**
   - H2: Main sections

### Writing Style Changes

**More Conversational:**

**Before (formal):**
"Research indicates that the carnivore diet may provide benefits for individuals with autoimmune conditions. Multiple studies have documented improvements in inflammatory markers."

**After (conversational):**
"Real talk: People with autoimmune conditions are seeing improvements on carnivore. Labs show lower inflammation, symptoms calm down, quality of life improves. Here's what the research actually says."

**Use These Techniques:**

1. **Contractions**
   - "Don't" not "Do not"
   - "You're" not "You are"
   - "It's" not "It is"

2. **Direct Address**
   - "You" not "one" or "people"
   - "Your body" not "the body"
   - "Here's what you need" not "What is needed"

3. **Shorter Sentences**
   - 15-20 words max
   - Vary length for rhythm
   - One idea per sentence

4. **Active Voice**
   - "Studies show" not "It has been shown"
   - "Eat organ meats" not "Organ meats should be eaten"
   - "Community members report" not "It is reported by community members"

5. **Personality**
   - "Okay, so..." (Chloe's opener)
   - "Real talk:" (introducing honesty)
   - "Here's the thing..." (transitioning)
   - "Bottom line:" (summarizing)

## Distribution Strategy

Detailed plans for each platform and distribution channel.

### Reddit Distribution

**Primary Subreddits:**
- r/carnivore (400k members) - Main audience
- r/zerocarb (80k members) - Strict carnivore
- r/animalbaseddiet (15k members) - Broader diet
- r/carnivorediet (20k members) - Growing community
- r/meatogains (fitness focus)

**Posting Strategy:**

**Format A: Breakdown Post (Best for Engagement)**

Don't just drop a link. Post the content breakdown directly to Reddit, add link at bottom.

**Template:**
```
[Catchy Reddit Title]

I spent [time] researching [topic] and here's what I found:

Thoughts? What's your experience been?
```

**Example:**
```
I tracked 100+ carnivore transformation stories. Here's what actually works.

**TL;DR:**
- 89% saw results in first 30 days (not just weight)
- Electrolytes = #1 factor for easy adaptation
- Most people under-eat protein initially

**What Worked Across All Stories:**

1. Salt everything (seriously)
2. Eat when hungry, don't force fasting
3. Simple meals (no fancy recipes needed)
4. Give it 90 days minimum

**Common Patterns:**

- Week 1-2: Hardest (energy crashes, cravings)
- Week 3-4: Turning point (energy returns)
- Week 6+: Feel amazing, never looking back

**What Varied:**

- Dairy: 50/50 split (some thrive, some don't)
- Organs: Not required but helpful
- Exercise: Most waited 2-4 weeks to resume

**Format B: Question Post (Drives Discussion)**

**Template:**
```
[Question based on blog post topic]

[Brief context]

Here's what I found researching this: [summary]

What's your experience?

[Optional: Link to full post]
```

**Example:**
```
How long did YOUR carnivore adaptation actually take?

Everyone says "2-4 weeks" but I'm seeing way more variation when I talk
to people. Some feel great by day 10, others struggle for 2 months.

From tracking 100+ stories:
- Fast adapters (under 2 weeks): Usually came from keto
- Average (3-4 weeks): Most people
- Slow adapters (6-8 weeks): Usually had metabolic issues

Full analysis here: [link]

But I want to hear from you:
- How long until you felt good?
- What made it easier/harder?
- Would you change anything?
```

**Best Practices:**

1. **Timing**
   - Post Tuesday-Thursday (highest traffic)
   - 9am-12pm EST (peak Reddit hours)
   - Avoid weekends (lower engagement)

2. **Engagement**
   - Reply to EVERY comment first 2 hours
   - Upvote good questions
   - Award helpful responses
   - Keep discussion going

3. **Follow Subreddit Rules**
   - r/carnivore: No self-promotion in title
   - r/zerocarb: Scientific sources required
   - Check each subreddit's rules before posting

4. **Build Karma First**
   - Comment on others' posts daily
   - Establish credibility
   - Don't link-dump
   - Contribute genuinely

**Posting Schedule:**
- 2-3 posts per week (different subreddits)
- Space posts 48+ hours apart
- Don't cross-post same content (customize for each)

**Example Thread:**

```
🧵 Everyone says carnivore raises cholesterol to dangerous levels.

I looked at 300+ community members who tracked labs for 6 months.

Here's what the data actually shows:

[1/9]

The fear: "Your LDL will skyrocket and you'll have a heart attack."

The reality: Way more nuanced than that.

[2/9]

What happened to LDL:
• 45% saw LDL increase
• 32% stayed roughly the same
• 23% saw LDL decrease

So yes, many people do see higher LDL. But not everyone.

[3/9]

But here's what matters more than LDL number:

PARTICLE SIZE changed in 87% of cases.

Small dense particles → Large fluffy particles

This is the actual marker of cardiovascular risk.

[4/9]

Other markers improved across the board:

• Triglycerides: Down 38% average
• HDL: Up 24% average
• A1C: Down 0.7 points average
• Inflammation markers: Down 45%

[5/9]

The pattern: Metabolic health improved even when LDL went up.

Why? Because LDL tells you NOTHING without context.

You need: particle size, inflammation, triglycerides, HDL.

[6/9]

Who saw LDL increases?

• Lean mass hyper-responders (lean, active people)
• Those who went from high-carb to carnivore
• People healing metabolic damage

All had excellent metabolic markers otherwise.

[7/9]

Who should monitor closely?

• Family history of early heart disease
• Pre-existing cardiovascular issues
• ApoB over 120 mg/dL

Work with a lipidologist who understands carnivore.

[8/9]

Bottom line:

LDL alone is a terrible marker. Track the full lipid panel,
inflammation, and metabolic health.

Most people improve across the board.

[9/9]
