# Medical Disclaimer Guide for Carnivore Weekly Writers

**Last Updated:** January 2026
**Purpose:** Central reference for integrating medical disclaimers naturally into your writing
**Version:** 1.0 (Hybrid System)

---

## The Hybrid Medical Disclaimer System

We use a two-tier approach to medical disclaimers:

### Tier 1: End-of-Post "Not a Doctor" Statement
**When:** ALWAYS if your post makes health claims
**Where:** At the end of the post, before sign-off
**Why:** Explicit boundary between education and medical advice

### Tier 2: Subtle Disclaimers Throughout Content
**When:** Based on content type and triggers
**Where:** Woven naturally into paragraph flow
**Why:** Readers understand limitations of specific claims as they read

**Key Principle:** Disclaimers should sound like YOU, not a lawyer.

## The 7 Disclaimer Categories

### Category 1: General Health/Nutrition Topics
**Triggers:** Posts about general health principles, nutrition concepts, metabolic processes
**Strength:** Mild, conversational
**When to use:** Early in post, sets educational context
**Tone:** Warmth, accessibility

#### Sarah's Variations (Scientific, Evidence-Based)
1. "This is general education about metabolic health patterns, not individualized medical guidance for your situation."
2. "I'm sharing what research and clinical observation show, but this isn't a personalized health plan for you specifically."
3. "These are educational insights based on science and what I've seen work—not medical advice tailored to your unique health picture."
4. "This information helps you understand general principles, but your body's response depends on your individual health status."

#### Marcus's Variations (Direct, Protocol-Focused)
1. "This is educational info on metabolism, not your personal health plan."
2. "I'm showing you what works in general. Your situation? That's between you and your doc."
3. "This is the protocol that works for most people. If you've got health issues, talk to someone who knows your case."
4. "General education here. Not telling you what to do with your specific health situation."

#### Chloe's Variations (Casual, Community-Insider)
1. "Real talk: This is educational stuff, not personalized medical advice for your specific situation."
2. "I'm sharing what I've learned and what the community talks about—not telling you what to do medically."
3. "This is general education vibes, not a health plan made specifically for you."
4. "I'm here to explain concepts, not give you medical guidance for your personal health."

#### Casey's Variations (Wellness-Oriented, Holistic)
1. "This information supports your understanding of wellness principles, but it's not personalized health guidance for you."
2. "I'm sharing general wellness insights here—not creating an individualized health plan for your specific needs."
3. "These are educational principles to support your health journey, not medical advice tailored to you."
4. "This content helps you understand wellness concepts, but your personal health needs may be different."

### Category 2: Research/Scientific Evidence
**Triggers:** Posts citing studies, research findings, scientific claims
**Strength:** Mild, contextual
**When to use:** After introducing research or citing studies
**Tone:** Evidence-focused, acknowledges individual variation

#### Sarah's Variations
1. "Research shows general patterns—your body may respond differently based on your unique health profile."
2. "These studies provide helpful context, but individual responses vary based on genetics, health history, and current conditions."
3. "The research I'm citing represents population trends. Your personal results may differ depending on your health baseline."
4. "Science gives us valuable insights, but remember these are general findings, not predictions for your specific case."

#### Marcus's Variations
1. "Research shows what happens on average. Your mileage may vary based on your health."
2. "These studies tell us general trends. Your body might respond differently—especially if you've got health conditions or take meds."
3. "Data shows general patterns. Individual response? Depends on your health baseline."
4. "The science backs this up, but your results depend on your unique situation."

#### Chloe's Variations
1. "Research shows general trends, but your body might do its own thing based on your health situation."
2. "These studies are helpful context, but everyone responds differently—especially if you've got health stuff going on."
3. "The research tells us what's typical. Your personal experience? Depends on your unique health context."
4. "Science gives us clues, but your individual response is about your specific health picture."

#### Casey's Variations
1. "Research provides valuable context, but your body's unique wisdom means your response may differ from general patterns."
2. "These studies offer helpful insights, though individual responses vary based on your health history and current state."
3. "The research shows what's common, but your personal experience depends on your unique health journey."
4. "Science guides our understanding, though your body's individual response is influenced by many personal factors."

---

### Category 3: Individual Variability
**Triggers:** Posts discussing outcomes, results, personal differences
**Strength:** Mild, reassuring
**When to use:** When explaining why results may vary person-to-person
**Tone:** Validating, acknowledges complexity

#### Sarah's Variations
1. "Everyone's baseline is different. What works for most may not work for you, especially if you have underlying health conditions."
2. "Your body's unique context—genetics, health history, current medications—means your experience may differ from these general patterns."
3. "Individual responses vary widely. If you have health conditions or take medications, your results may look different."
4. "Bodies respond differently to the same approach. Your health status, medications, and genetics all influence outcomes."

#### Marcus's Variations
1. "Bodies are different. If you're on meds or have conditions, your results won't match the average."
2. "Your health status changes the game. What works for most might not work for you."
3. "Individual responses vary. Health conditions, meds, genetics—all change outcomes."
4. "What I describe works in general. Your context determines if it's right for you."

#### Chloe's Variations
1. "Okay so everyone's different. If you have health conditions or take meds, you might see totally different results."
2. "Your body is unique. What works for most might not work for you, especially if you've got health things happening."
3. "Individual results vary wildly. Your health baseline, meds, genetics—all that stuff affects outcomes."
4. "Bodies are weird and unique. Your health status determines what'll actually work for you."

#### Casey's Variations
1. "Each body has its own wisdom. What serves most people may not serve you, particularly if you're managing health conditions."
2. "Your body's unique needs—influenced by your health history, medications, and individual constitution—shape your experience."
3. "Individual responses vary beautifully. Your health context, medications, and personal history all influence outcomes."
4. "Bodies express themselves differently. Your health status and personal journey determine what's right for you."

---

### Category 4: Tool/Calculator Disclaimers

2. "These calculations offer educational context, but they can't account for your individual health variables. Use them as learning tools, not medical diagnostics."
3. "This tool shows what's typical for general populations. Your personal numbers may differ based on your unique health profile."
4. "Calculators give estimates—not diagnoses. If your results concern you, discuss them with someone who knows your full medical picture."

#### Marcus's Variations
1. "This calculator shows averages. Not a medical test. Not personalized to you."
2. "These numbers are estimates based on general populations. Use them for education, not diagnosis."
3. "Calculator gives you ballpark figures. Your actual numbers? Get them checked properly."

#### Chloe's Variations
1. "This calculator shows general estimates. It's educational, not a medical diagnostic tool."
2. "These calculations are based on averages. They can't know your personal health situation."
3. "The tool gives you ballpark numbers for learning. Not actual medical testing."

1. "This calculator offers general estimates for educational purposes. It's not a replacement for personalized health assessment."
2. "These tools provide context based on averages, but they can't honor your body's unique needs and circumstances."
3. "This educational tool shows typical patterns. Your personal health numbers may differ based on your individual constitution."
4. "Calculators support learning but can't replace the nuanced understanding of your complete health picture."

## Placement Philosophy: How to Integrate Naturally

### Good Placement Examples

**✅ After introducing a concept:**
> "Research shows carnivore improves insulin sensitivity. [Category 2 disclaimer: 'Research shows general patterns—your body may respond differently based on your unique health profile.'] Here's what the studies actually found..."

**✅ Before actionable advice:**
> "Extended fasting can amplify results. [Category 5 disclaimer: 'Fasting can affect medication absorption. If you take any medications, consult your healthcare provider before starting.'] Here's the protocol..."

**✅ In tool introduction:**
> "Use this macro calculator to estimate your needs. [Category 4 disclaimer: 'This calculator provides estimates based on population averages. It's not a substitute for personalized medical assessment.'] Just enter your stats..."

**✅ At section transitions:**
> "[End of major section] [Category 6 disclaimer: 'These are general principles—your personal health context determines what's appropriate for you.'] Now let's talk about..."

### Poor Placement Examples

**❌ Mid-sentence interruption:**
> "Your blood sugar [Category 3 disclaimer] responds differently to..."

**❌ Multiple disclaimers in same paragraph:**
> "[Category 1 disclaimer] [Category 2 disclaimer] [Category 3 disclaimer]"

**❌ Disclaimer without related health claim:**
> "I eat beef every day. [Category 7 disclaimer about medications]"

**❌ Legal-sounding language that breaks voice:**
> ❌ "DISCLAIMER: The information herein is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."
> ✅ Instead: Use natural disclaimers from your category variations

## Self-Check Validation: Before You Submit

Before submitting your post to Jordan, go through this checklist:

### Health Claims Review
- [ ] Does my post make health claims? If YES, read below.
- [ ] If NO, you might skip disclaimers (consult category 1-7 anyway to be safe).

### High-Risk Content Check
- [ ] Did I mention medications or prescriptions? → Category 7 REQUIRED
- [ ] Did I mention diagnosed medical conditions? → Category 7 REQUIRED
- [ ] Did I describe acute symptoms? → Category 7 REQUIRED
- [ ] Did I mention fasting, electrolytes, gout, or chronic conditions? → Category 5 REQUIRED

### Disclaimer Presence Check
- [ ] Do I have at least one disclaimer matching my content type?
- [ ] Do I have an end-of-post "Not a Doctor" statement?
- [ ] If high-risk content, do I have a Category 7 disclaimer?

### Voice Check
- [ ] Do my disclaimers sound like ME, not a lawyer?
- [ ] Does the language match my persona (Sarah: scientific / Marcus: direct / Chloe: casual / Casey: wellness)?
- [ ] Would I say this to a friend?

### Placement Check
- [ ] Are disclaimers placed naturally within sentences, not interrupting flow?
- [ ] Is there roughly one disclaimer per major concept/section?
- [ ] Does the density feel right (not every paragraph)?
- [ ] Did I avoid mid-sentence interruptions?

### Final Check
- [ ] Does my end-of-post disclaimer match my voice?
- [ ] Did I proofread all disclaimer language?
- [ ] Could a reader understand my content limitations clearly?

## Common Mistakes (And How to Fix Them)

### ❌ Mistake 1: Using "Consult Your Doctor" in Every Disclaimer
**Why it's wrong:** Only Category 7 (medications, diagnoses, acute symptoms) should include "consult your doctor" language. Others are premature.

**Example of wrong approach:**
> "Insulin resistance can improve on carnivore. [Generic disclaimer: 'Consult your doctor about any changes.']"

**Fix:** Use Category 3 instead:
> "Insulin resistance can improve on carnivore. [Category 3: 'Individual responses vary widely. If you have health conditions or take medications, your results may look different.']"

**Why it works:** You're addressing the real issue (variability) without unnecessary medical supervision language.

---

### ❌ Mistake 2: Adding Disclaimers to Every Paragraph
**Why it's wrong:** Excessive disclaimers make content feel defensive and interrupt reading flow.

**Example of wrong approach:**
> "Carnivore [Category 1]. focuses on meat [Category 3]. and water [Category 2]. You eat when hungry [Category 1]. Stop when full [Category 3]."

**Fix:** One disclaimer per major concept or section:
> "Carnivore focuses on meat and water. You eat when hungry, stop when full. [Category 1: 'This is general education about nutrition concepts, not medical advice tailored to you.'] Different people have different needs."

**Why it works:** You acknowledge complexity without interrupting the flow. Readers understand the educational boundary once and can continue reading.

---

### ❌ Mistake 3: Legal-Sounding Language That Breaks Voice
**Why it's wrong:** Robotic disclaimers sound like lawyers, not you. Readers feel like you're hiding something.

**Example of wrong approach:**
> ❌ "DISCLAIMER: The information herein is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease and is strictly educational in nature."

**Fix:** Use natural variations from your category:

**Sarah's way (scientific):**
> "This information helps you understand general principles, but your body's response depends on your individual health status."

**Marcus's way (direct):**
> "General education here. Not telling you what to do with your specific health situation."

**Chloe's way (casual):**
> "I'm here to explain concepts, not give you medical guidance for your personal health."

**Casey's way (wellness):**
> "This content helps you understand wellness concepts, but your personal health needs may be different."

**Why it works:** Readers trust you because you sound human, not defensive.

---

### ❌ Mistake 4: Missing Category 7 on Medication/Diagnosis Content
**Why it's wrong:** This is dangerous. If you mention medications, diagnoses, or acute symptoms without a strong disclaimer, Jordan's Validator 2B will flag it as a CRITICAL FAILURE and block publication.

**Example that will fail validation:**
> "Taking metformin for diabetes? You might consider carnivore since it improves insulin sensitivity. Most people see results within weeks."

**Fix:** Add Category 7 disclaimer:
> "Taking metformin for diabetes? Here's what you should know. [Category 7: 'If you're taking medications or have been diagnosed with any medical condition, you need individualized medical oversight. Don't make changes without consulting your doctor.'] Most research shows improved insulin sensitivity, but your doctor needs to monitor your medication..."

**Why it works:** You're setting clear boundaries. Jordan validates presence and readers understand the requirement for medical supervision.

## How Jordan Validator 2B Works

Jordan has been enhanced with **Validator 2B: High-Risk Medical Content Detection**.

### What Validator 2B Does

1. **Scans your content** for high-risk keywords:
   - Medications: "prescription", "medication", "drug", specific drug names
   - Diagnosed conditions: "diagnosed with", "type 1 diabetes", "heart disease", etc.
   - Acute symptoms: "chest pain", "difficulty breathing", "severe pain", etc.

2. **If high-risk keywords found**, checks for Category 7 disclaimer presence:
   - Looks for phrases like "taking medications", "diagnosed condition", "medical oversight", "consult your doctor", "healthcare provider"

3. **If high-risk content found WITHOUT Category 7 disclaimer**:
   - **CRITICAL FAILURE** (blocks publication)
   - Shows you exactly which keywords triggered it
   - References this guide for the fix

### Example Validator 2B Failure

```
========================================
VALIDATOR 2B: HIGH-RISK MEDICAL CONTENT
========================================

Status: ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE

Issue: Content discusses medications without appropriate Category 7 medical disclaimer.

Triggered Keywords:
- "prescription" (line 47)
- "metformin" (line 52)
- "diagnosed with type 2 diabetes" (line 63)

Required Action:
Add Category 7 disclaimer in [Your Voice]. This is the STRONGEST disclaimer category and is REQUIRED when discussing medications or diagnosed conditions.

Suggested Fix (Sarah's voice):
"If you're taking medications or have been diagnosed with any medical condition, you need individualized medical oversight. Don't make changes without consulting your doctor."

Reference: /docs/medical-disclaimer-guide.md → Category 7 → [Your Name] Variations
```

### How to Fix Validator 2B Failures

1. **Find the triggered keywords** in your content
2. **Go to Category 7** in this guide (or your persona file)
3. **Choose a variation** that matches your voice
4. **Add it naturally** before or after the high-risk content
5. **Resubmit** to Jordan
