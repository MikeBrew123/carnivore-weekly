## Getting Started

### What's New?

On January 8, 2026, we redesigned the Carnivore Weekly homepage with five new features designed to help you discover trending topics, learn health terminology, understand community perspectives, and access expert weekly insights.

### Quick Tour

**First time visiting?** Here's what you'll see:

1. **At the very top**: Carnivore Weekly logo and navigation menu
2. **Hero section**: This week's most important health insight from Sarah (featured prominently)
3. **Right side**: Trending topics the community is discussing
4. **Below**: Additional content in a sophisticated grid layout
5. **Throughout**: Underlined health terms you can click for definitions

**Time investment**: 5 minutes to get oriented, then dig deeper based on your interests.

### Mobile vs. Desktop

- **On desktop**: You'll see 3 columns of content (hero content on left, secondary content on right)
- **On tablet**: Content shifts to 2 columns (hero spans full width)
- **On mobile**: Everything stacks in a single column for easy scrolling
- **In all cases**: All features work exactly the same way

## Feature-by-Feature Guide

### Feature 1: Bento Grid Layout

**What it does**: Organizes content in a smart grid so you see more important information immediately.

#### How to navigate

1. **Scan the layout**: Notice content is organized by size
   - Larger boxes = more important content (like Sarah's weekly insights)
   - Medium boxes = secondary content
   - Smaller boxes = supporting content

2. **Know what matters**: The grid is designed to show you 5-7 important pieces of content before you even scroll

3. **Understand the visual hierarchy**:
   - Top-left: Usually the weekly hero content
   - Top-right: Secondary featured content
   - Below: Supporting content continues the story

#### Pro tips

- **Desktop**: Use the natural eye flow from left to right and top to bottom
- **Mobile**: Just scroll naturally—the grid handles the layout
- **Hover on desktop**: Move your mouse over cards to see them highlight and lift slightly

### Feature 2: Trending Topic Explorer

### Feature 3: Wiki Auto-Linker

**What it does**: Turns health and nutrition terms into clickable definitions you can learn from instantly.

#### How to spot linked terms

- Look for **underlined words** or **colored text** throughout content
- These are interactive definitions
- They'll be obvious—not every word is linked, just important health terms

#### How to use on desktop

1. **Find an underlined term** while reading
2. **Hover your mouse** over it
3. **A popup appears** with:
   - 1-2 sentence definition
   - "Learn More" link to full article
   - Example or usage (sometimes)
4. **Move your mouse away** to close the popup
5. **Or click "Learn More"** to visit the full article

### Feature 4: Sentiment Threads

**What it does**: Shows you different perspectives on health topics so you see the full picture.

#### How to find it

- Look for **"Community Sentiment"** cards on the homepage
- Usually appears as a dedicated section
- Shows trending topics with perspective breakdowns

#### How to read it

1. **Find a topic** you're interested in
2. **Look at the sentiment breakdown**:
   - Bar showing % positive, neutral, negative
   - Click any section to filter to that perspective

**Example**: "Carnivore diet for weight loss"
- 65% Positive (success stories, weight loss wins)
- 25% Neutral (how long does it take, tracking methods)
- 10% Negative (plateaus, slow progress)

3. **Filter to one perspective** to see only those comments
4. **Read actual discussion snippets** from the community
5. **Click a snippet** to see the full comment in context on YouTube

- **Make balanced decisions**: Understand the full range of outcomes before starting
- **Learn from others**: Get tips from what worked and what didn't work
