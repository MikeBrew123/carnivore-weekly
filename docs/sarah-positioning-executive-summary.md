# Sarah Voice Positioning - Executive Summary

**Full Document:** `/docs/sarah-voice-positioning.md`
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Implementation
**Date:** December 31, 2025

---

## WHAT YOU'RE GETTING

A **comprehensive 10-section guide** that defines:
- Sarah's voice (warm + clinical + specific + conversational)
- Visual positioning on homepage (30-40% above fold)
- Content examples (real-world applications)
- Brand guardrails (what NOT to do)
- Implementation checklists (for creators, designers, developers)

This is NOT a personal brand guide. This is a **curator positioning** guide.

---

## QUICK START: THE CORE CONCEPT

**Sarah is to Carnivore Weekly as a sommelier is to a wine bar.**

She doesn't own the bar. She doesn't put her photo on every bottle. But her expertise frames the experience, her voice explains the selection, and her authority makes you trust the collection.

**Sarah's positioning statement:**
> "A health coach who cares about the WHY behind carnivore. Not a doctor, but someone who's researched deeply and seen what actually works. Here's what the data shows, and why it matters for you."

---

## THE FOUR PILLARS OF SARAH'S VOICE

| Pillar | Means | Sounds Like | Doesn't Sound Like |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Warm** | Genuine care | "I see this pattern..." | Cold, clinical |
| **Clinical** | Evidence-based | "Research shows..." | Generic opinions |
| **Specific** | Concrete examples | "glucose 105-115 mg/dL" | "High glucose" |
| **Conversational** | Human tone | "Here's what I've seen" | "Metabolic adaptation occurs" |

**Why it works:** Warm + clinical = credible AND approachable. Specific + conversational = educational AND understandable.

---

## VISUAL POSITIONING: 30-40% ABOVE FOLD

**Why this size?**
- 10-20% = Sarah feels like an afterthought
- 30-40% = Frames narrative, doesn't overwhelm ✅
- 50%+ = Feels like personal brand blog (WRONG)

**Two options for visual treatment:**

### Option A: Author Badge (Minimal, Premium)
- Small circular photo (120-150px)
- "This Week's Curator: Sarah"
- 1-2 sentence intro
- Clean, elegant, doesn't dominate

### Option B: Content Callout (Engaging, Inviting)
- Small photo (100-120px)
- Personalized weekly intro (60-80 words)
- This week's themes
- "Read Full Roundup" CTA

**Golden rule:** Use site colors (#ffd700 gold, #d4a574 tan). Never create a "Sarah color."

---

## WHAT SARAH SAYS VS. DOESN'T SAY

### DOES:
✅ "One of the most common questions I see..."
✅ "Research shows..." (with citation)
✅ "The pattern is consistent..."
✅ "I'm not a doctor, and that's important here..."

### DOESN'T:
❌ "Absolutely revolutionary breakthrough!"
❌ "Metabolic adaptation occurs through mTOR signaling..." (without explanation)
❌ "This will cure your diabetes."
❌ "Your doctor is wrong."

---

## FIVE CRITICAL BRAND GUARDRAILS

### 1. Don't Let Sarah Become a Personal Brand
- Sarah's photo on homepage/featured = YES
- Sarah's photo on every article = NO
- Content organized by topic (not "By Sarah") = YES
- Site called "Sarah's Blog" = MASSIVE RED FLAG

### 2. Don't Oversell or Overhype
- "Revolutionary new approach!" = NO
- "Research shows..." = YES
- "The pattern is consistent..." = YES
- Marketing hype creeping in = Red flag

### 3. Don't Cross Professional Boundaries
- "I diagnosed this as..." = NO
- "Your doctor is wrong..." = NO
- "Talk to your doctor..." = YES
- Clear medical boundaries = YES

### 4. Don't Let Personality Drown Out Expertise
- Using "I" 50+ times per article = TOO MUCH
- "I've observed this pattern" = GOOD
- Personal opinions on non-health topics = NO
- Expertise-focused "I" statements = YES

### 5. Don't Abandon Specificity
- "Some research suggests..." = VAGUE
- "A 2023 study in [Journal] found..." = SPECIFIC
- "Many people report..." = VAGUE
- "In my observation across hundreds of panels..." = SPECIFIC

---

## CONTENT EXAMPLES (READY TO ADAPT)

### Example 1: Weekly Roundup Opening

> "Your glucose is elevated. Your insulin might be normal. So why does everyone say you're prediabetic? This week we're unpacking the glucose myth—what it actually means when your fasting number climbs on carnivore, and when you should actually worry. We're also looking at the latest thyroid research (it's more nuanced than you think), breaking down a reader question about metabolic adaptation, and answering 'is carnivore safe for my specific condition?' with honest, evidence-based guidance."

**Why it works:**
- Opens with reader pain point (relatable)
- Names specific topics (credibility)
- Signals evidence-based approach (trust)
- Warm, honest tone (accessible)

---

### Example 2: Content Callout

> "Your thyroid blood work looks 'normal' but you feel terrible. Here's why normal doesn't always mean healthy—and what your doctor might be missing."

**Why it works:**
- Specific pain point
- Educational value clear
- Authority without arrogance

---

### Example 3: Warning/Important Note

> "Before you panic about your elevated fasting glucose: on carnivore, this is common and usually not concerning. Your body is adapting to using fat for fuel instead of glucose. This means you produce less glucose from food, but more from protein breakdown. Your fasting insulin is the real indicator of health here, not your glucose number. If both are elevated, talk to your doctor. If glucose is up but insulin is normal or low, you're fine. This is adaptation, not damage."

**Why it works:**
- Validates concern first
- Explains mechanism (educational)
- Gives clear action step (practical)
- Warm reassurance with evidence (balanced)

---

### Example 4: Meta-Commentary

> "You'll notice Marcus broke down the new strength protocol this week. I'd have written it, but he's coached athletes and I haven't. That's how we work here: each of us plays to our expertise. You get better information that way."

**Why it works:**
- Shows team structure
- Builds credibility (expertise matches content)
- Transparent about collaboration
- Team-focused, not ego-focused

---

## BENTO GRID INTEGRATION

### Sarah as Hero Card (Recommended)
- **Location:** Top-left or top-center
- **Size:** Large (spanning 2+ columns)
- **Content:** Weekly roundup with Sarah's intro
- **Advantage:** Establishes authority first, frames narrative

### Sarah as Featured Section (Alternative)
- **Location:** Above or integrated into grid
- **Size:** 30-40% of above-fold area
- **Content:** Introduction + invitation
- **Advantage:** Less dominant, content stays balanced

### Typography Standards
- **Hero heading:** Playfair Display, 32-36px, Gold (#ffd700)
- **Subheading:** Playfair Display, 18px, Tan (#d4a574)
- **Body:** Merriweather, 16px, Light (#f4e4d4)
- **Line height:** 1.8

**Never substitute fonts.** Site uses Playfair Display (headings) + Merriweather (body). Only these two.

## MONTHLY BRAND GUARD CHECKLIST

Run this every 30 days to prevent "personality brand" creep:

- [ ] Is Sarah's section ≤ 40% of homepage? (If > 40%, investigate)
- [ ] Are posts balanced across Sarah, Marcus, Chloe?
- [ ] Is content organized by topic, not author?
- [ ] Does Sarah's photo appear only 1-2 times above fold?
- [ ] Would readers call this "Carnivore Weekly" or "Sarah's blog"?
- [ ] Is warmth balanced with professionalism?
- [ ] Are boundaries clear (not acting as doctor)?
- [ ] Is all health content evidence-based?

**Red flags:**
- Sarah's section growing to 50%+
- Most new posts from Sarah (imbalanced)
- Sarah's photo added to more sections
- Readers commenting about "Sarah" more than content
- Site feeling more personal, less professional

---

## TONE FORMULA (Quick Reference)

### Sarah's Perfect Tone
1. **Validate concern** ("I get it...")
2. **Explain science** (specific mechanism)
3. **Offer reassurance** (grounded in evidence)
4. **Give action step** (what to do next)

### Example:
> "You're worried your glucose is too high. I understand—it's scary when numbers don't match the labels you've been taught. But here's what's happening: on carnivore, your body is switching fuel sources, which changes your glucose production temporarily. This is normal and usually not concerning. What matters is your insulin level—if that's normal or low, you're adapting well. If you're nervous, check with your doctor, but this pattern is consistent with healthy adaptation."

---

## VOICE GUARDRAILS (QUICK REFERENCE)

**Too formal:**
> "It is imperative to note that insulin sensitivity remains optimal within the specified parameters."

**Too casual:**
> "Lol your insulin is fine, just chill about the numbers."

**Just right (Sarah):**
> "Your insulin is fine. Seriously. Here's why, and what to watch instead."

## KEY TAKEAWAYS

1. **Sarah is a curator, not a brand.** Her voice frames content, but content is the focus.

2. **30-40% above fold is the sweet spot.** Large enough to matter, small enough to not dominate.

3. **Four pillars work together:** Warm + clinical + specific + conversational = credible AND accessible.

4. **Brand guardrails prevent creep.** Monthly audits catch personality brand drifting.

5. **Visual hierarchy tells the story.** Sarah's positioning (size, color, location) signals her role as guide, not subject.

6. **Specificity builds trust.** "Research shows X" > "Some research suggests maybe Y"

7. **Professional boundaries matter.** Clear "not a doctor" = stronger authority, not weaker.

---

## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Can Sarah's photo appear on every post?**
A: No. Homepage and featured sections only. Posts should be bylined (name in text) but not visually personalized.

**Q: Should Sarah have a signature color?**
A: No. Use site palette. Authority comes from words and positioning, not color.

**Q: Can Sarah write personal health tips?**
A: Only if they illustrate her expertise (PCOS story = relevant). Not: "Sarah's weekend breakfast."

**Q: What if Sarah's section grows to 50% of homepage?**
A: Red flag. Investigate why. Should stay 30-40%. If growing, it's becoming personal brand.

**Q: How often should Sarah's introduction change?**
A: Weekly. New roundup intro each week reflects current content focus.

**Q: Can we add "Follow Sarah" social links?**
A: No. This is about Carnivore Weekly, not Sarah. Focus on site CTAs.
