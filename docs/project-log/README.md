# Project Log System

This directory tracks project progress, decisions, and daily work.

## Files

**current-status.md**
- What we're working on now
- Any blockers preventing progress
- What's queued next
- Updated at end of each session

**decisions.md**
- All significant architectural or strategic decisions
- Why we chose each option
- What alternatives were considered
- Helps avoid repeating past discussions

**daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md**
- Notes from each work session
- Goals, accomplishments, blockers
- Creates an audit trail of progress
- Reviewed during standups

## How It Works

Quinn updates these files after each session. Run `/standup` to see progress summary and priorities.
