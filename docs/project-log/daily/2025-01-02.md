# 2025-01-02

**Session Goals:**
- Set up project documentation system
- Configure Quinn as operations manager
- Establish daily logging process
- Audit scattered markdown files and extract insights

**What Got Done:**
- Created docs/project-log/ directory structure (README, templates, daily logs)
- Set up Quinn as operations manager with clear responsibilities
- Updated CLAUDE.md with triggers, file management rules, weekly review, markdown cleanup processes
- Updated Leo.md with Memory Architecture responsibility + Supabase Memory Constraints
- Created directory structure: plans/, research/{studies,mechanisms,critiques}, specs/, notes/{inbox,archive}
- Audited 300+ markdown files across project
- Extracted high-confidence decisions and key assumptions

**What Changed Today:**
- Documentation system now centralized in docs/project-log/
- Quinn owns daily logs, status, decisions, memory reviews
- File organization framework established (PLAN | RESEARCH | SPEC | NOTE | JUNK | ARCHIVE)
- Long-term memory pathway to Supabase identified

**Decisions Made:**
- All markdown cleanup extractions go to Supabase via Leo before archiving
- docs/project-log/ is single source of truth (non-negotiable)
- Architecture decisions locked and documented (Phase 2 complete)
- Weekly memory review + daily logging = institutional memory system

**Assumptions in Play:**
- 10% bounce rate improvement achievable post-Bento launch (Jan 27)
- 30% adoption rate for interactive features (no baseline established)
- Real-time engagement scoring necessary (could optimize to hourly batch)
- Claude AI maintains consistent persona voice across 9 writers (98.3% token reduction achieved)

**Open Questions:**
- What's the false-negative rate on content validators? (Copy-Editor, Brand, Humanization)
- Should engagement scoring be real-time or batch? (Cost optimization opportunity)
- Email newsletter integration priority? (Documented but not scheduled)

**Extracted Insights (Worth Remembering):**
- Technology stack locked: Python 3.9, Claude AI, GitHub Pages, Supabase (PostgreSQL, 4-table core)
- Validation pipeline is core brand moat: All content passes 3 validators before publishing
- Persona system database-backed: voice formulas stored in writers table, 37.75ms query time
- Bento Grid launch locked to Jan 27, 2025 (3 MVP features, 5-person team, 129 hours)
- Phase gate process prevents scope creep: CEO approval required for all changes
- Deployment readiness culture: 100+ item checklists, rollback procedures, contingency buffers
- Token optimization proven: prompts reduced from 10,000 to 174 tokens (98.3% reduction)

**Files Touched / Reviewed:**
- Created: CLAUDE.md, docs/project-log/README.md, current-status.md, decisions.md, TEMPLATE.md
- Updated: .claude/agents/quinn.md (40 lines, concise), .claude/agents/leo.md (added Memory Architecture)
- Reviewed: 300+ markdown files for audit and classification

**Supabase Deployment:**
- ✅ Created `knowledge_entries` table (append-only, immutable)
- ✅ Schema: id, type, title, summary, source_file, confidence, tags, created_at
- ✅ RLS policies: INSERT allowed, UPDATE/DELETE prohibited
- ✅ Indexes: type, confidence, source_file, tags, created_at
- ✅ Loaded 17 initial knowledge entries (8 decisions, 3 insights, 4 assumptions, 2 research)
- Status: LIVE (in Supabase knowledge_entries table)

**Weekly Knowledge Report Job (Leo):**
- ✅ Deterministic markdown function created
- ✅ Query playbook: 5 approved read-only queries
- ✅ Schedule: Sundays 18:00 UTC (via pg_cron)
- ✅ Output: Append to docs/project-log/weekly/weekly-knowledge-report.md
- ✅ Constraints: Read-only (no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

## EVENING SESSION UPDATE - January 2, 2026 (7:45 PM)

**Session Focus:** Prepare agents and automation for weekly build cycle. Implement homepage markdown rendering + Supabase data caching + agent role updates.

**Wins Today (Evening Session):**

✅ **Fixed YouTube Thumbnails & Descriptions**
- Updated youtube_collector.py to extract thumbnail URLs from YouTube API
- Updated generate.py to pass video_id and description to template
- Fixed index_template.html to display descriptions below creator names
- Thumbnails now rendering using YouTube's mqdefault.jpg URLs
- Descriptions will populate on next weekly run with fresh data

✅ **Added Professional Markdown Rendering**
- Installed markdown library for converting markdown to HTML
- Added markdown filter to Jinja2 template system
- Created comprehensive CSS styling for all markdown elements:
  * Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h6) with Playfair Display font
  * Table styling with brand colors (brown/gold)
  * Lists, blockquotes, code blocks, dividers
  * Responsive design for all markdown elements
- Updated index_template.html to render weekly_summary with markdown filter
- Result: Sarah's analysis now displays as professional HTML, not raw markdown

✅ **Implemented Supabase Data Caching**
- YouTube collector now writes to youtube_videos table in Supabase
- Generator prioritizes Supabase (cached) → JSON → analysis data
- Result: Next weekly run uses cached data (ZERO YouTube API calls if fresh data exists)
- Reduces rate limit risk and improves build speed

✅ **Updated Agent Roles for Weekly Automation**
- **Chloe** new primary role: Weekly blog topic curation
  * Checks data/published_blogs.json for recent posts
  * Filters topics published in last 80 days (prevents repetition)
  * Weights topics by trending intensity
  * Prevents topic clustering ("butter" can't trend 3 weeks straight)
  * Outputs: data/blog_topics_queue.json (prioritized, Sunday)

- **Chloe** second primary role: Weekly social media report
  * Monitors: Instagram, Reddit, TikTok, Twitter/X, YouTube, Discord
  * Documents trending creators + commenter sentiment + WHY trending
  * Outputs: agents/daily_logs/CHLOE_COMMUNITY_REPORT_[DATE].md

- **Sarah** new primary role: Weekly homepage welcome
  * Uses Chloe's report + YouTube data to generate narrative
  * Replaces current analysis display with warm welcome
  * Applied via Claude Code with copy-editor + humanization skills
  * 4-5 paragraphs, readable, proper markdown formatting
  * First impression = 100% polished

✅ **Created Blog Tracking System**
- data/published_blogs.json: Registry of all 14 published blogs with topics/dates
- data/blog_topics_queue.json: Example prioritized topic queue with deduplication logic
- 80-day cooldown rule prevents topic repetition
- System prevents clustering (one trend doesn't dominate weeks)

**Files Updated:**
- agents/chloe.md: Added weekly curation + social report roles
- agents/sarah.md: Added weekly homepage welcome role
- templates/index_template.html: Markdown rendering filter + CSS styling
- scripts/youtube_collector.py: Supabase write functionality
- scripts/generate.py: Markdown filter + Supabase cache priority

**Commits:**
1. "Fix missing YouTube thumbnails and descriptions on homepage"
2. "Add Supabase caching for YouTube API data"
3. "Add professional markdown rendering for homepage summary"
4. "Update agent roles: Chloe's weekly curation + Sarah's homepage welcome"

**Decisions Made:**
- Markdown rendering is default for all homepage content (no raw markdown visible)
- Supabase is primary data source for YouTube videos (reduces API calls)
- Blog topics follow 80-day deduplication rule (no repeating topics)
- Chloe's weekly report is prerequisite for Sarah's homepage generation
- Sarah's homepage welcome replaces direct analysis display

**Assumptions Validated:**
- YouTube API caching in Supabase works (tested with collector)
- Markdown rendering with proper CSS styling achieves professional look
- 80-day deduplication rule feasible with published_blogs.json tracking
- Weekly agent workflow (Chloe → Sarah) is sustainable

**Tomorrow's Priority (Jan 3):**
- Load markdown cleanup insights to knowledge_entries table
- Classify and move markdown files (PLAN/RESEARCH/SPEC/NOTE/JUNK/ARCHIVE)
- Create archive summary (what was saved, where)
- Test weekly memory review process

**Next Week's Automation Ready?**
- ✅ Supabase caching for YouTube data (LIVE)
- ✅ Homepage markdown rendering (LIVE)
- ✅ Chloe role: Weekly social report + blog topic curation (DEFINED)
- ✅ Sarah role: Weekly homepage welcome (DEFINED)
- ⏳ Automation integration: Need to hook Chloe/Sarah into weekly build script
- ⏳ Blog topic deduplication: Needs final automation logic in generate.py
