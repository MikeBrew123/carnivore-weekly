# 2025-01-02

**Session Goals:**
- Set up project documentation system
- Configure Quinn as operations manager
- Establish daily logging process
- Audit scattered markdown files and extract insights

**What Got Done:**
- Created docs/project-log/ directory structure (README, templates, daily logs)
- Set up Quinn as operations manager with clear responsibilities
- Updated CLAUDE.md with triggers, file management rules, weekly review, markdown cleanup processes
- Updated Leo.md with Memory Architecture responsibility + Supabase Memory Constraints
- Created directory structure: plans/, research/{studies,mechanisms,critiques}, specs/, notes/{inbox,archive}
- Audited 300+ markdown files across project
- Extracted high-confidence decisions and key assumptions

**What Changed Today:**
- Documentation system now centralized in docs/project-log/
- Quinn owns daily logs, status, decisions, memory reviews
- File organization framework established (PLAN | RESEARCH | SPEC | NOTE | JUNK | ARCHIVE)
- Long-term memory pathway to Supabase identified

**Decisions Made:**
- All markdown cleanup extractions go to Supabase via Leo before archiving
- docs/project-log/ is single source of truth (non-negotiable)
- Architecture decisions locked and documented (Phase 2 complete)
- Weekly memory review + daily logging = institutional memory system

**Assumptions in Play:**
- 10% bounce rate improvement achievable post-Bento launch (Jan 27)
- 30% adoption rate for interactive features (no baseline established)
- Real-time engagement scoring necessary (could optimize to hourly batch)
- Claude AI maintains consistent persona voice across 9 writers (98.3% token reduction achieved)

**Open Questions:**
- What's the false-negative rate on content validators? (Copy-Editor, Brand, Humanization)
- Should engagement scoring be real-time or batch? (Cost optimization opportunity)
- Email newsletter integration priority? (Documented but not scheduled)

**Extracted Insights (Worth Remembering):**
- Technology stack locked: Python 3.9, Claude AI, GitHub Pages, Supabase (PostgreSQL, 4-table core)
- Validation pipeline is core brand moat: All content passes 3 validators before publishing
- Persona system database-backed: voice formulas stored in writers table, 37.75ms query time
- Bento Grid launch locked to Jan 27, 2025 (3 MVP features, 5-person team, 129 hours)
- Phase gate process prevents scope creep: CEO approval required for all changes
- Deployment readiness culture: 100+ item checklists, rollback procedures, contingency buffers
- Token optimization proven: prompts reduced from 10,000 to 174 tokens (98.3% reduction)

**Files Touched / Reviewed:**
- Created: CLAUDE.md, docs/project-log/README.md, current-status.md, decisions.md, TEMPLATE.md
- Updated: .claude/agents/quinn.md (40 lines, concise), .claude/agents/leo.md (added Memory Architecture)
- Reviewed: 300+ markdown files for audit and classification

**Supabase Deployment:**
- ✅ Created `knowledge_entries` table (append-only, immutable)
- ✅ Schema: id, type, title, summary, source_file, confidence, tags, created_at
- ✅ RLS policies: INSERT allowed, UPDATE/DELETE prohibited
- ✅ Indexes: type, confidence, source_file, tags, created_at
- ✅ Loaded 17 initial knowledge entries (8 decisions, 3 insights, 4 assumptions, 2 research)
- Status: LIVE (in Supabase knowledge_entries table)

**Weekly Knowledge Report Job (Leo):**
- ✅ Deterministic markdown function created
- ✅ Query playbook: 5 approved read-only queries
- ✅ Schedule: Sundays 18:00 UTC (via pg_cron)
- ✅ Output: Append to docs/project-log/weekly/weekly-knowledge-report.md
- ✅ Constraints: Read-only (no INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

**Tomorrow's Priority:**
- Load markdown cleanup insights to knowledge_entries table
- Classify and move markdown files (PLAN/RESEARCH/SPEC/NOTE/JUNK/ARCHIVE)
- Create archive summary (what was saved, where)
- Test weekly memory review process
