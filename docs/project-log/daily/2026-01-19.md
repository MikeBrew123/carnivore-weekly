**Focus:** WCAG 2.1 Accessibility - Color Contrast Fixes

---

## Session Summary

Fixed critical WCAG 2.1 color contrast violations across all 30 blog posts. Dark text on dark backgrounds was unreadable, particularly in TL;DR boxes and styled components.

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. WCAG Color Contrast Audit
- Identified dark text (#333, #444) on dark brown backgrounds (#2a1810) causing readability issues
- Affected elements: TL;DR boxes, styled components, highlights across all blog posts
- Violation: Failed WCAG 2.1 AA standard (requires 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text)

### 2. Parallel Agent Fix (5 agents)
- Deployed 5 parallel agents to fix CSS in batches
- Updated text colors to light cream (#e8dcc8) for body text
- Gold emphasis (#ffd700) retained for headings and highlights
- All 30 blog posts updated simultaneously

### 3. WCAG Contrast Validator Created
- New skill: `~/.claude/skills/visual-validator/test-color-contrast.js`
- Validates WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (4.5:1 normal text, 3:1 large text)
- Can be used for future accessibility audits

### 4. Browser Verification
- Verified fixes visually in browser
- TL;DR boxes now readable with light cream text on dark brown
- Gold emphasis preserved for brand consistency
- No regressions in other page elements

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Why |
|----------|-----|
| WCAG 2.1 AA as validation standard | Industry standard, legally defensible, good UX |
| 4.5:1 minimum contrast for normal text | WCAG 2.1 AA requirement |
| 3:1 minimum contrast for large text (18pt+) | WCAG 2.1 AA requirement |
| Light cream (#e8dcc8) for body text on dark backgrounds | High contrast while maintaining brand warmth |
| Gold (#ffd700) for emphasis/headings on dark backgrounds | Brand color with sufficient contrast for large text |

## Blockers

## Next Session

1. Run WCAG contrast validator on remaining pages (homepage, channels, calculator)
2. Consider accessibility audit for keyboard navigation
3. Continue strategic planning from GROWTH-STRATEGY-2026.md review

## Files Changed

- 30 blog post HTML files (CSS updates)
- `~/.claude/skills/visual-validator/test-color-contrast.js` (new)
