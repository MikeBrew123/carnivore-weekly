## Decisions Made

### Content Strategy
- 📋 **7-day content calendar:** Rotating Sarah/Marcus/Chloe for topic diversity
- 📋 **Topic selection:** Mix of science (Sarah), motivation (Marcus), practical (Chloe)
- 📋 **Writer assignment logic:**
  - Sarah: Research, hormones, metabolic health, autoimmune
  - Marcus: Performance, discipline, strength, mindset
  - Chloe: Social situations, practical tips, community

### Validation Approach
- 📋 **"Leverage" in scientific context is acceptable:** "Protein Leverage Hypothesis" is a real scientific term (Simpson & Raubenheimer)
- 📋 **Strict humanization rules maintained:** No AI tells in conversational text, contractions required
- 📋 **SEO elements mandatory:** All posts include complete metadata, schema markup, tracking

### Automation Workflow
- 📋 **Weekly generation on demand:** Posts created when scheduled dates are added to blog_posts.json
- 📋 **Daily publishing fully automated:** GitHub Actions handles publication at 9 AM EST
- 📋 **No pre-flight content review:** Trust validation pipeline, post-publish QA if needed

## Technical Notes

### Writer Agent System Working Correctly
- Each writer has distinct voice and expertise
- Humanization prompts built into generation script
- Validation catches AI tells automatically
- Content quality consistently high (800-1200 words, natural tone)

### Blog Posts JSON Structure
- Total posts: 57 (50 published, 7 scheduled)
- New posts prepended to array
- scheduled_date field drives automation
- published flag toggled by daily script

### Validation Pipeline
- 7-point check runs during generation
- Posts with critical issues are deleted (fail-fast)
- Warnings logged but don't block publication
- SEO elements validated (meta description, canonical URL, CSS, fonts)
