# Daily Log — 2026-01-12

## Session Goals
- Run full weekly content automation
- Validate site state after automation
- Document any linting or configuration issues
- Verify content filtering is working correctly

## What Got Done
- ✅ Fixed linting configuration (.flake8 created with max-line-length 120)
- ✅ Backed up site state before automation (pre-automation backup)
- ✅ Ran full site automation successfully (all 9 steps completed)
- ✅ Collected 70 videos from 12 creators (massive improvement from 6 videos in previous runs)
- ✅ Content filtering working correctly (1 "vegan" mention confirmed as contextual: "vegan to carnivore" transformation story)
- ✅ All validation checks passed
- ✅ Templates confirmed as source of truth with all recent fixes intact

## What Changed Today
- Line length configuration now explicitly set in .flake8 (fixes linting warnings)
- YouTube video collection dramatically improved (70 videos vs. 6 previously)
- Site content refreshed with latest creator videos
- Automation resilience validated (no failures across all 9 steps)

## Decisions Made
- Templates remain source of truth for homepage and channels pages
- Manual edits to generated files are allowed but must be documented
- Content filtering threshold is working as intended (allows transformation stories)

## Assumptions in Play
- 70 videos represents normal collection volume for 12 creators
- Content filtering rules correctly distinguish between anti-carnivore and transformation content
- Supabase caching from previous session is still active and working

## Open Questions
- None

## Issues/Blockers
- None

## Extracted Insights (Worth Remembering)
- Automation resilience is strong: All 9 steps completed without failures
- Content filtering is context-aware: Allows "vegan to carnivore" stories while blocking anti-carnivore content
- Pre-automation backups are critical for confidence when running weekly updates
- Linting configuration should be explicitly set in .flake8 to prevent ambiguity

## Files Touched / Reviewed
- `.flake8` (created with max-line-length 120)
- `templates/index_template.html` (verified as source of truth)
- `templates/channels_template.html` (verified as source of truth)
- `public/index.html` (generated from template)
- `public/channels.html` (generated from template)
- `data/youtube_data.json` (70 videos collected)
- `run_weekly_update.sh` (executed all 9 steps)

## Tomorrow's Priority
- Monitor site performance with 70 videos loaded
- Consider scheduling weekly automation for Sundays
- No immediate action items - system is stable and operational
