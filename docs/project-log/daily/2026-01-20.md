## Session Focus: GEO (Generative Engine Optimization) Implementation

---

## Accomplishments

### 1. SEO-GEO Skill Installation
- Installed seo-geo-2026 skill from `/Users/mbrew/Developer/Skills/seo-geo-skill`
- Installed to `~/.claude/skills/seo-geo-2026/`
- Skill provides GEO auditing capabilities for AI search visibility

### 2. Full GEO Audit on carnivoreweekly.com
**Audit Results:**
| Metric | Score | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Entity Density | 2.83% | Good |
| AI Bot Access | 5/5 bots GRANTED | Excellent |
| GEO Score | 3/10 | Needs improvement |
| Schema | FAIL | No JSON-LD found |

**AI Bots with Access:**
- OAI-SearchBot (OpenAI)
- PerplexityBot
- Applebot-Extended
- Googlebot
- Bingbot

### 3. JSON-LD Schema Implementation (Schema Fix)
Added structured data to fix the Schema FAIL:

**WebSite Schema:**
- name: Carnivore Weekly
- url: https://carnivoreweekly.com
- description: Weekly carnivore diet research, tools, and insights

**Organization Schema:**
- name: Carnivore Weekly
- url: https://carnivoreweekly.com
- logo: /images/cw-logo-gold.png
- description: No-bullshit carnivore diet research

**Files Updated:**
- `public/index.html` (immediate production)
- `templates/index_template.html` (survives weekly automation)

**Note:** sameAs links omitted (YouTube empty, no Twitter account yet)

### 4. Deployment
- Committed: "Add JSON-LD schema for GEO/Knowledge Graph visibility"
- Deployed to production

## GEO Score Breakdown

**Current Score: 3/10**

What we have:
- Entity density is solid (2.83%)
- All AI bots can access the site
- Basic JSON-LD schema now in place

What we need for higher score:
- Question-based headers (convert "Overview" to "What is X?")
- Comparison tables for AI extractability
- FAQ Schema on blog posts
- More structured content patterns

---

## Decisions

### Decision: sameAs Links Deferred
**Context:** JSON-LD Organization schema supports sameAs links (YouTube, Twitter, etc.)
**Decision:** Will add sameAs links later when YouTube has content and/or Twitter account is created
**Rationale:** Empty social links provide no value; better to add when accounts are active

---

## Remaining GEO Improvements (Future Work)

**Priority improvements for 7-8/10 GEO score:**
1. Convert headers to question format ("What is the carnivore diet?" vs "Overview")
2. Add comparison tables (AI systems extract tabular data well)
3. Add FAQ Schema to blog posts
4. Implement HowTo schema for calculator/tools

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 hours for significant improvement

---

## Technical Notes

- GEO skill location: `~/.claude/skills/seo-geo-2026/`
- Schema added to both template and production file to ensure persistence
- Entity density above 2% is considered good for AI extraction

---

## Next Actions
1. Monitor Google Search Console for schema validation
2. Consider question-based header conversion for high-traffic pages
3. Add FAQ Schema to top 5 blog posts
4. Add sameAs links when social accounts are active

---

**Session End:** GEO foundation established, site now has basic Knowledge Graph visibility
