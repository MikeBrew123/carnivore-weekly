## Decision Log

### Calculator SEO - Do Not Touch
**Decision:** Do not modify calculator SEO until stability is confirmed. Calculator is receiving traffic and functioning correctly. Leave it alone.

**Rationale:** Working features that are generating traffic should not be modified without clear necessity. Stability over optimization.

## Known Issues (Deferred)

### Calculator SEO Minor Issues
1. **Canonical URL inconsistency** - Calculator canonical points to `/calculator.html` instead of `/calculator/`. Minor SEO inconsistency, not urgent.
2. **Assessment/success page** - Redirect page has no SEO tags. Acceptable since it functions as a redirect.

**Status:** Documented for future reference. No action required until calculator stability is confirmed.
