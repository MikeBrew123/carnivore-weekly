- New template: `templates/feed_template.xml`

## Quinn Logging Fix

**Problem Identified:** Quinn confirmed logging complete but files were never written. Root cause was conflicting instructions between `.claude/agents/quinn.md` and `CLAUDE.md` about where to write logs, plus no verification step.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated `.claude/agents/quinn.md` with single source of truth (docs/project-log/)
2. Added CRITICAL verification requirement - must run `ls` or `cat` after write
3. Updated `CLAUDE.md` with Quinn Logging Protocol section
4. Deprecated old locations: `agents/daily_logs/`, `memory.log`

**Prevention:** Quinn now cannot report "logging complete" until bash verification confirms file exists.

## Evening Session (Jan 25)

### Blog Image & SEO Audit Work

**Ghost Avatar Images Fixed:**
- Fixed missing avatar images on `environmental-impact.html`
- Fixed missing avatar images on `insulin-resistance.html`
- Images were referencing non-existent paths

**Blog Audit Discovery:**
- Identified need for methodical 1-by-1 blog audit across all 40 posts
- Batch update approaches have failed - too many edge cases per post
- Each post has unique issues (images, links, formatting)

**SEO Audit Completed:**
- Audited top 5 blog posts for SEO best practices
- Identified meta description gaps
- Identified internal linking opportunities

**Hero Images Created:**
- Generated hero images with proper branding
- Applied brand color palette (gold accents, cream backgrounds)

**Decision Made:**
- Batch updates do not work for blog post fixes
- Tomorrow: Page-by-page audit starting from post 1
- Each post gets individual attention for images, links, schema

## Jan 29 Session: Crawlability Audit & Fix

### Critical Issues Found & Fixed

**Problem:** Site had been up for a month but wiki/blog pages weren't indexing in Google.

**Root Cause:** Jan 25 clean URL migration had three blind spots:
1. Hash fragment links (`#dairy`) weren't caught by search pattern
2. Relative links (no leading `/`) weren't caught
3. Blog post generation had template variable bug leaving `slug` empty

### Fixes Applied (5 commits)

| Commit | Fix | Files |
|--------|-----|-------|
| `95c539e` | `/wiki.html` → `/wiki/` absolute links | 64 |
| `9869800` | Relative links, broken canonicals, subdirectory nav | 34 |
| `c6a237d` | Remove 14 duplicate blog posts | 37 |
| `e1d8c8d` | Add 17 posts to blog_posts.json + sitemap | 4 |
| `4e830b0` | Fix remaining relative wiki.html in blog content | 15 |

### Final State
- 40 blog HTML files (down from 54 - removed duplicates)
- 50 entries in blog_posts.json (up from 33)
- 63 URLs in sitemap (up from 43)
- 0 broken wiki.html or blog.html links
- All key pages verified: robots.txt, sitemap.xml, feed.xml, wiki/, blog/

### Decisions
- Keep 2025-12-* dated posts (original, complete, in sitemap)
- Delete 2025-01-* duplicates (incomplete, wrong slugs)
