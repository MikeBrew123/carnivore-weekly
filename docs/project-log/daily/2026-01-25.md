**Converted blog index from hardcoded HTML to Jinja2 data-driven template**
- Old: 1,090 lines of manually edited HTML with posts embedded inline

- Newsletter signup preserved

**RSS feed generation added**
- New template: `templates/feed_template.xml`
- Output: `public/feed.xml`

- Fixed empty `lastBuildDate` bug (now uses newest post date)

**Schema improvements for GEO**
- Added `sameAs` links (YouTube, Twitter, Instagram) to Blog schema

## Quinn Logging Fix

**Problem Identified:** Quinn confirmed logging complete but files were never written. Root cause was conflicting instructions between `.claude/agents/quinn.md` and `CLAUDE.md` about where to write logs, plus no verification step.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated `.claude/agents/quinn.md` with single source of truth (docs/project-log/)
2. Added CRITICAL verification requirement - must run `ls` or `cat` after write
3. Updated `CLAUDE.md` with Quinn Logging Protocol section
4. Deprecated old locations: `agents/daily_logs/`, `memory.log`

**Prevention:** Quinn now cannot report "logging complete" until bash verification confirms file exists.
