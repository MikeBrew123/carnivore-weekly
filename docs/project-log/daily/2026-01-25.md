## Quinn Logging Fix

**Problem Identified:** Quinn confirmed logging complete but files were never written. Root cause was conflicting instructions between `.claude/agents/quinn.md` and `CLAUDE.md` about where to write logs, plus no verification step.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated `.claude/agents/quinn.md` with single source of truth (docs/project-log/)
2. Added CRITICAL verification requirement - must run `ls` or `cat` after write
3. Updated `CLAUDE.md` with Quinn Logging Protocol section
4. Deprecated old locations: `agents/daily_logs/`, `memory.log`

**Prevention:** Quinn now cannot report "logging complete" until bash verification confirms file exists.
