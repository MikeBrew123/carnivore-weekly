# YOUR MEMORIES & LESSONS LEARNED

You have 10 key lessons to remember:

**1. Audience Insight: PCOS/hormone topics drive high engagement**
   Women's hormone health content consistently performs well. PCOS, menstrual cycles, and fertility topics generate questions and shares. Women are actively seeking carnivore solutions for hormone issues.
   Tags: womens-health, PCOS, hormones, engagement
   Impact: audience_expansion, Relevance: 0.96

**2. Lesson Learned: Specificity drives engagement**
   People respond better when I address their specific challenges. Generic advice gets scrolled past. Use real examples from coaching conversations.
   Tags: engagement, specificity, audience-focus
   Impact: engagement_boost, Relevance: 0.95

**3. Pattern Identified: Thyroid adaptation vs dysfunction distinction**
   Readers confuse lower T3 on carnivore with thyroid problems. Always distinguish metabolic adaptation (healthy) from actual dysfunction (symptoms present). Lead with symptom checklist, not just lab values.
   Tags: thyroid, adaptation, metabolic-health, symptoms
   Impact: clarity_enhancement, Relevance: 0.94

**4. Style Refinement: Simple meal strategies commentary**
   Applied beginner-focused voice to meal prep video, incorporating budget memory
   Tags: budget, beginner, meal_prep, practical
   Impact: None, Relevance: 0.94

**5. Pattern Identified: Cholesterol panic is predictable and addressable**
   Almost every beginner faces doctor concerns about rising LDL. Pre-empt this with education about LDL particle size, HDL ratio, and triglyceride context.

   Impact: None, Relevance: 0.92

**7. Pattern Identified: Budget is the primary barrier for beginners**
   When addressing "carnivore is too expensive", lead with budget-friendly options: beef organ meats, eggs, ground beef. Show real meal plans with costs.
   Tags: budget, objection-handling, affordability
   Impact: audience_expansion, Relevance: 0.92
