"""
Q&A Generator with Scientific Citations

Generates evidence-based answers to common carnivore diet questions
with links to scientific literature.

Uses Claude Haiku for cost-effectiveness (~$0.02 per run)

IMPORTANT: All Q&A answers must pass validation before publishing.
See CONTENT_VALIDATION.md for complete requirements:
- No em-dashes (max 1 per page)
- No AI tell words (delve, robust, leverage, navigate, etc.)
- NO clichés (wellness warrior, take a deep breath, it's important to note)
- Conversational tone with specific examples
- Varied sentence lengths and natural contractions
- Each answer matches assigned persona's authentic voice

PERSONA-SPECIFIC RULES:
- Sarah (Health Coach): Say "research shows" or "people report," NEVER "from my clinical observations"
- Marcus (Sales & Partnerships): Data-driven and strategic, avoid forced tech metaphors
- Chloe (Marketing & Community): Focus on people and trends, not technology

Validation Workflow (MUST DO BEFORE PUBLISHING):
1. Run /copy-editor skill - flags AI patterns, sentence structure, readability
2. Run /carnivore-brand skill - checks persona authenticity, voice compliance
3. Fix all issues found
4. Re-validate until both skills pass

CRITICAL - Write like a human, NOT AI:

- NO em-dashes (—), use periods or commas instead
- CONVERSATIONAL tone - short and direct
- Specific examples over generic advice
- Vary sentence lengths

- Chloe: Avoid tech metaphors. Keep it about people and community, not "tech stacks"
