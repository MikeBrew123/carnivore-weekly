## 🎯 Your Mission
Write content that **people actually want and use**. Use the data to guide every decision.

---

## 📊 WHAT THE DATA TELLS US

### **The Top Performers:**
1. **Calculator Tool** (216 views) - Interactive, problem-solving
2. **Channels** (203 views) - Curated resources, saves time
3. **Wiki** (201 views) - Educational, reference-able

### **The Key Insight:**
People come for **practical help**, not entertainment or opinions.

---

## ✅ FRAMEWORK FOR EVERY PIECE OF CONTENT

Before writing, ask yourself:

### **1. DOES IT SOLVE A PROBLEM?**
- ✅ "How to calculate macros on carnivore" → Problem-solving
- ✅ "Best carnivore YouTubers" → Saves research time
- ✅ "Carnivore diet basics explained" → Educational resource
- ❌ "My carnivore breakfast today" → Opinion/diary (low value)
- ❌ "Why I think carnivore is trending" → Opinion piece (low performing)

**Action:** If it doesn't solve a problem, add a problem-solving angle.

---

### **2. WILL SOMEONE RETURN TO THIS LATER?**
- ✅ Wiki entry → Yes (bookmarked reference)
- ✅ Calculator → Yes (recurring utility)
- ✅ Resource list → Yes (go-to recommendation)
- ❌ News article → Maybe (one-time read)
- ❌ Opinion → No (forgotten tomorrow)

**Action:** Create "evergreen" content, not time-sensitive pieces.

---

### **3. DOES THIS ADD TO EXISTING RESOURCES?**
- ✅ "New Wiki section: Nutrient Deficiencies" → Adds to education
- ✅ "5 New Carnivore Meal Prep Tools" → Expands resources
- ✅ "Advanced Macro Calculator for Athletes" → Enhances existing tool
- ❌ "Generic carnivore tips everyone knows" → Duplicate
- ❌ "Basic stuff already on our Wiki" → Redundant

**Action:** Check existing content first. Expand, don't repeat.

## 📋 CONTENT CHECKLIST

Before publishing, verify:

- [ ] **Solves a real problem** OR **provides reference information**
- [ ] **People will return to this** (not one-time read)
- [ ] **Not a duplicate** of existing content (check Wiki/Channels/Archive first)
- [ ] **Links internally** to Calculator, Wiki, or Channels where relevant
- [ ] **At least 150+ words** if a tool/resource, 500+ if educational
- [ ] **Searchable title** (people search for solutions, not opinions)
- [ ] **Clear call-to-action** pointing to next step

---

## 🔗 INTERNAL LINKING STRATEGY

**Every piece of content should link to:**
1. **Calculator** - "Ready to track your macros? Try our calculator"
2. **Wiki** - "Learn more about [topic] in our Wiki"
3. **Channels** - "Want more resources? Check our curated channels"

**Why?** Top pages get 200+ views because they're linked. Help new content succeed.

## 📊 YOUR WEEKLY CHECKLIST

Every 7 days, ask yourself:

- [ ] Did I **curate new resources**?

- [ ] Did I **avoid opinion pieces**?
- [ ] Did my content get **100+ views** in first week?

**If most are ✅, you're on the right track.**
**If most are ❌, recalibrate toward tools + education + curation.**
