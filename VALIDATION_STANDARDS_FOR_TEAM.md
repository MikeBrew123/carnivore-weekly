# Validation Standards for Blog Content Team

**For:** Anyone writing blog posts for Carnivore Weekly
**Purpose:** Understand what the 3 validation skills check for
**Result:** Content that passes validation on first submission

---

## The 3-Skill Validation Pipeline

Every blog post must pass these 3 validators before publishing:

1. **Copy-Editor** (Removes AI tells, ensures human-quality writing)
2. **Carnivore-Brand** (Ensures persona voice consistency)
3. **AI-Text-Humanization** (Confirms authentic human voice)

**Why 3?** Each catches different problems:
- Copy-Editor = technical writing quality
- Brand = voice & consistency
- Humanization = personality & authenticity

**Bottom line:** Post must read like a real person wrote it, in the right voice, with no AI tells.

---

## VALIDATOR 1: Copy-Editor

### What It Checks

**CRITICAL (Automatic Fail):**
- **Em-dashes (—)** - Maximum 1 per post, preferably ZERO
  - Replace with: periods, commas, colons, or rewrite the sentence
  - Example: "Your body adapted—that's actually good" → "Your body adapted. That's actually good."

**AI Tell Words (Red Flags):**
- "Delve" / "Delving" - Nearly always AI
- "Robust" - Corporate AI speak
- "Leverage" (as verb) - AI buzzword
- "Navigate" (metaphorically) - AI cliché
- "Crucial" / "Critical" (overused) - Sounds robotic
- "Realm" / "Landscape" / "Tapestry" - Overwrought
- "Utilize" - Just say "use"
- "Facilitate" - Say "help" or "make easier"
- "Implement the functionality" - Say "make it work"
- "It's important to note that..." - AI opening pattern

**AI Sentence Patterns (Red Flags):**
- All sentences same length/structure (no variety)
- Excessive transition words: "Furthermore," "Moreover," "Nevertheless" appearing multiple times
- Overly formal transitions
- Multiple em-dashes in same paragraph

### What Passes

✅ **Varied sentence lengths** - Mix short punchy ones with longer ones
```
Bad: "Your body is incredibly smart. When you eat very few carbs, your muscles stop storing glucose as their primary fuel. They switch to using fat and ketones instead."

Good: "Your body is incredibly smart. It adapts. When carbs drop, muscles switch to fat. That's not breaking—that's efficiency."
```

✅ **Natural contractions** - Don't, can't, won't, you're, it's (used naturally, not forced)
```
Bad: "You should not ignore this. We cannot stress enough how important this is."
Good: "Don't ignore this. We can't stress enough how important it is."
```

✅ **Direct address** - Speak to "you" the reader
```
Bad: "Many people experience this."
Good: "You've probably experienced this."
```

✅ **Specific examples** - Not generic platitudes
```
Bad: "Eating meat provides benefits."
Good: "A 12oz ribeye gives you 400mg of omega-3s and 30g of complete protein."
```

✅ **Conversational flow** - Reads naturally when read aloud
✅ **Reading level** - Grade 8-10 (Flesch-Kincaid 60-70)

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| ❌ AI Tell | ✅ Fix |
|-----------|--------|
| "This is crucial to understand" | "You need to know this" |
| "Robust evidence supports this" | "Research shows this works" |
| "We must leverage this opportunity" | "We should use this" |
| "Navigate the challenges" | "Handle the challenges" / "Work through this" |
| "In order to optimize" | "To optimize" / "To get better results" |
| "The landscape of..." | "The state of..." / "What's happening with..." |
| "It's important to note that..." | Start with the fact, not the disclaimer |

## VALIDATOR 2: Carnivore-Brand

### What It Checks

**Voice Consistency:** Each persona has a distinct voice

#### Sarah (Health Coach)
**Should sound:**
- Educational but warm (not lecturing)
- Evidence-based (cite sources, data)
- Nurturing (shows genuine care)
- Explains the "why" behind things

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Too formal/academic
- ❌ No data or sources cited
- ❌ Cold or dismissive tone
- ❌ Generic health advice without evidence

**Example Sarah:**
> "Your fasting glucose is 110. I get why you're worried. But here's what the research actually shows..."

#### Marcus (Performance Coach)
**Should sound:**
- Direct and punchy (no fluff)
- Performance-focused (results matter)
- Practical with numbers (metrics, protocols)
- High-energy coaching vibe

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Fluffy or wishy-washy language
- ❌ No concrete numbers or protocols
- ❌ Motivational speaker tone (too hyped)
- ❌ Unclear action steps

**Example Marcus:**
> "You've been stuck for 4 weeks. That's not failure—that's adaptation. Here's the fix: PSMF for 2-4 weeks, 1.2-1.5g protein per lb lean mass, zero added fat."

#### Chloe (Community Manager)
**Should sound:**
- Conversational and relatable (like talking to a friend)
- Humorous (light, not forced)
- Trend-aware (what the community is talking about)
- Insider perspective (been in the trenches)

**Red flags:**
- ❌ Too formal or stiff
- ❌ Forced humor or slang
- ❌ No community context
- ❌ Sounds disconnected from real life

**Example Chloe:**
> "Okay so Lion Diet is blowing up right now and I need to talk about why this is actually interesting instead of just restrictive."

### Brand Voice Standards (All Personas)

**DO:**
- ✅ Be direct and clear (get to the point)
- ✅ Use evidence and data to support claims
- ✅ Professional but accessible language
- ✅ Conversational when appropriate

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Excessive praise ("absolutely fantastic," "incredibly amazing")
- ❌ Marketing hype without substance
- ❌ Academic jargon
- ❌ Overly casual slang or emojis (unless Chloe)

### Disclaimers Must Match Persona Voice

**Sarah's "Not a Doctor":**
> "I'm a health coach and an AI-trained bio-hacker, not a clinical doctor. While my stories are built to simplify science, your health is a solo mission—please check with your MD before changing your protocol."

**Marcus's "Not a Doctor":**
> "ROI matters, but safety is the ultimate asset. I'm a strategic persona and performance specialist. Don't trade your health for a headline—talk to a professional before you pivot."

**Chloe's "Not a Doctor":**
> "I'm your trend-spotting digital bestie! I read the comments so you don't have to, but I don't have a medical degree. Always clear the 'Prime Cuts' with your real-life doctor!"

## VALIDATOR 3: AI-Text-Humanization

### What It Checks

**Authentic voice and personality shining through**

✅ **Natural phrasing** - Not stiff or formal
```
❌ "The manifestation of metabolic adaptation occurs through mitochondrial remodeling."
✅ "Your mitochondria are adapting. Your metabolism is shifting."
```

✅ **Varied sentence structure** - Not all the same length
```
❌ "Your body needs carbs. Your body stores glucose. Your body uses insulin."
✅ "Your body needs carbs. It stores them as glucose. Insulin is the key that unlocks the door."
```

✅ **Conversational flow** - Reads naturally when read aloud
- Try reading it out loud. Does it sound like a real person talking?
- Or does it sound like a robot reading a report?

✅ **Realistic examples and anecdotes** - Not generic scenarios
```
❌ "Some people experience side effects."
✅ "Week two hits and you're waking up at 3 AM absolutely drenched."
```

✅ **Personal perspective** - Author's voice comes through
```
❌ "Research indicates that individuals may experience energy fluctuations."
✅ "I've seen people hit an energy wall around day 10. It's temporary."
```

✅ **Authentic personality** - Unique to the persona
- Sarah: Warm, caring, scientific
- Marcus: Direct, practical, no-nonsense
- Chloe: Fun, relatable, insider vibes

### Common Humanization Mistakes

| ❌ Robotic | ✅ Human |
|-----------|----------|
| "One might consider implementing..." | "You might want to try..." |
| "The aforementioned protocol..." | "That protocol I mentioned..." |
| "Individuals who engage in..." | "People who try..." |
| "Notwithstanding the challenges..." | "Despite the challenges..." |
| "In conclusion, it behooves the reader to..." | "So here's what you should do..." |

### The "Read Aloud" Test

**Before submitting, read your post out loud.**

- Does it sound like a real person talking? ✅ PASS
- Does it sound robotic or overly formal? ❌ FAIL
- Would you say this to a friend? ✅ PASS
- Does it sound like a Wikipedia article? ❌ FAIL

## How to Avoid Mistakes

### 1. Write in Your Persona's Voice
- Don't try to sound smart or formal
- Write like you're texting a friend about this topic
- Sarah: Educational friend, Marcus: Coach friend, Chloe: Community friend

### 2. Show Don't Tell
```
❌ "Carnivore causes rapid fat loss."
✅ "You'll lose fat fast. Most people see 2-4 pounds per week in the first month."
```

### 3. Be Specific
```
❌ "This has benefits."
✅ "Your triglycerides drop. Your inflammation markers improve. Your sleep gets deeper."
```

### 4. Read Out Loud
- This catches 80% of problems
- If it sounds weird reading aloud, rewrite it

### 5. Cut Corporate/Academic Language
- "Utilize" → "Use"
- "Facilitate" → "Help"
- "Leverage" → "Take advantage of"
- "Navigate" → "Handle" / "Work through"

### 6. Vary Your Sentences
```
❌ All long: "Your body adapts to burning fat instead of carbs, which causes your metabolism to shift, which leads to weight loss over time."

✅ Mixed: "Your body adapts. Fat becomes fuel. Metabolism shifts. Results follow."
```

## Real Examples (From Published Posts)

### ✅ Sarah (Pass)
> "One of the most common panic moments I see in the carnivore community happens around week three. Someone gets their fasting blood glucose checked. It's higher than it was on a standard diet. They freak out. They think carnivore broke their metabolism or they're developing diabetes. This is actually normal. And it's not what most people think it is."

**Why it passes:**
- Opens with personal observation ("I see")
- Relatable scenario (specific, not generic)
- Conversational tone
- Short/long sentence mix
- Uses contractions ("It's")
- Direct address to reader

### ✅ Marcus (Pass)
> "New Year's resolutions are trash. Let me be direct about that. They're designed to fail. You wake up January 1st with explosive motivation, you set some vague goal like 'eat healthier' or 'lose weight,' you crush it for a week, then by January 10th you're back to your old habits wondering what happened."

**Why it passes:**
- Direct opening ("are trash")
- Punchy, no fluff
- High energy
- Specific example (Jan 10th)
- Conversational ("Let me be direct")

### ✅ Chloe (Pass)
> "Okay so Lion Diet is blowing up in the community right now and I need to talk about why this is actually interesting instead of just restrictive. Lion Diet is literally three things: beef, salt, water. That's it. No other meat. No organs. No fat from other sources."

**Why it passes:**
- Opens conversationally ("Okay so...")
- Community insider vibe ("blowing up," "you")
- Casual but clear
- Specific details
- Relatable tone

## Questions?

If you're unsure whether something will pass validation:
1. Ask yourself: "Would I say this to a friend?"
2. Read it out loud
3. Check the pre-submission checklists above
4. Compare to real examples (see section above)

**When in doubt, err toward: simpler, shorter sentences + more specific examples + more authentic voice.**

---

## Summary

The 3 validators want:
- **Copy-Editor:** Human-quality writing (no AI tells, varied sentences)
- **Brand:** Right voice for the persona (authentic tone, clear message)
- **Humanization:** Real person vibe (conversational, personality-driven)

**All three together = content that reads like a real person wrote it, in their own voice, with no AI tells.**

Write like you talk. Be specific. Show personality. That's it.
