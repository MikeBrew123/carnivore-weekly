The carnivore community just spent the holidays arguing about the same thing that's tanked more diets than cheat days: how much fat you actually need to eat. And the timing? *Chef's kiss* – because January is about to flood the space with confused beginners who think chicken breast counts as carnivore.

Anthony Chaffee won that race with 88K views and a simple message everyone's quoting: "Eat the damn fat." The coordinated timing isn't coincidence – these creators know January is their Super Bowl, and they're positioning NOW to catch the resolution crowd before they screw it up with lean meat and calorie counting.

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

This week vs last week? Honestly, it's the same conversation getting LOUDER. The 2026 blueprint content that started trickling out last week just hit critical mass. But here's the shift worth watching: nutrient completeness fears are creeping up the priority list. 

Ken Berry's B1/pork video signals something important – the community's maturing past "just eat steak" into "how do I actually optimize this long-term?" Meanwhile, weight loss stalls are becoming the uncomfortable truth no one wanted to discuss during the honeymoon phase. Courtney Luna and Max German both tackled it this week, and the comment sections are FULL of people admitting they're stuck after initial success.

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

The comments this week reveal a massive wave of 30-90 day carnivores hitting their first real challenge: boredom and stalls. Recipe content is surging as a direct response – people want carnivore pancakes and ice cream because eating ribeyes forever sounds better in theory than practice. 

The other big vibe? Former vegetarians are LOUD right now, sharing dramatic health turnarounds and basically becoming the movement's best evangelists. One commenter on Chaffee's video called their previous plant-based life "slow suicide" which... tells you everything about the energy in these communities.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

Watch for the beginner surge to peak in the next 2-3 weeks as New Year's resolutions kick in. The creators who win January will be the ones who can hold someone's hand through week two when the adaptation symptoms hit and Taco Bell sounds like heaven. 

Also keep an eye on the fat-vs-protein debate – it's going to define Q1 2026. This isn't just academic; it's the difference between people succeeding or rage-quitting back to "balanced" diets.

The blueprint wars have officially started, and the stakes are high: whoever captures the resolution crowd now owns their results for the year.
