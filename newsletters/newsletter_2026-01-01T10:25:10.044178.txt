CARNIVORE WEEKLY INSIDER
Week of 2026-01-01T10:25:10.044178

Subject: The carnivore internet went silent (here's why that matters)

Hey friend,

Sarah here. Something weird happened this week: absolutely nothing.

Zero carnivore videos made waves. The algorithm served up a vegan refried beans recipe instead. And honestly? This might be the most interesting thing that's happened all month.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

Complete radio silence. 0 videos posted. 0 trending carnivore content. 

Meanwhile, The Plant Slant (yes, a plant-based channel) racked up 367K views on beans. The carnivore community took a collective holiday nap, and the algorithm filled the vacuum with whatever it could find. When nobody shows up to the party, someone else gets the spotlight.

🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS

Marcus checking in. This week's leaderboard is... empty. But that's the insight.

• Every major carnivore creator ghosted for the holidays
• The space went dark between Christmas and New Year's
• First mover advantage is sitting there, unclaimed, for anyone posting right now

Think about it: New Year's searches are spiking TODAY and there's no fresh content to catch them.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

Here's what shifted: last week was quiet. This week? Even quieter.

But zoom out and you'll see the pattern. Holiday weeks are content graveyards because creators think nobody's watching. Wrong. People are home, scrolling, making "New Year, new me" plans at 11pm on January 2nd.

The Plant Slant figured this out. They posted January 1st with humor and personality. Short form, relatable, meme-worthy. Their comment section blew up with jokes and shares.

That formula works just as well for ribeyes as it does for beans.

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

Chloe here! Without fresh content, I've been watching the comments on older videos. Three things people keep asking:

"How do I start carnivore after the holidays without feeling miserable?" The sugar hangover is real and they want quick wins, not lectures.

"Can I do this while traveling?" January is when people return to normal life and panic about maintaining the diet.

Also seeing lots of "my family thinks I'm crazy" posts. The New Year amplifies that tension because everyone's suddenly a nutrition expert with their resolutions.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

This dead zone won't last. By next week, we'll see the "I tried carnivore for 7 days" videos start dropping. 

Watch for carnivore vs. vegan January challenge content. It's clickbait gold and creators know it. Also expecting a wave of "carnivore meal prep for beginners" tutorials because that's what the searches are screaming for right now.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The takeaway? Sometimes the story is what DIDN'T happen. The creators who publish this week will own the algorithm while everyone else is still digesting Christmas ham.

Stay hungry,

P.S. If you're a creator reading this: post something today. Anything. The algorithm is literally begging for carnivore content right now.
