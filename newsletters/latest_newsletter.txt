CARNIVORE WEEKLY INSIDER
Week of 2025-12-26
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subject: The great dairy divorce (and why everyone's suddenly drinking pickle juice)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The carnivore community is having its first real identity crisis, and it's messy. Dr. Chaffee just told 70K viewers that dairy is why they're failing, while half the comments section is basically "pry my cheese from my cold, dead hands."

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

OptimalHealth just pulled off something wild - 4.5 MILLION views on a video about India's diet transformation, absolutely obliterating everyone else this week. We're talking 5.7M total views across just 11 videos, with one creator capturing 93% of eyeballs. Meanwhile, the strict carnivore crowd (Steak and Butter Gal's dip recipe at 172K) is playing a completely different game. The gap between viral carnivore-adjacent content and pure carnivore content has never been wider, and that's telling us something about where the real audience growth is happening.

🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS

→ OptimalHealth is in a different league right now - their mainstream approach to seed oils and traditional fats is reaching audiences the ribeye crowd can't touch. Two videos, 5.3M views. That's not a win, that's a masterclass.

→ HomeSteadHow cracked the code on engagement - 1,779 comments on a sauerkraut juice video proves people are desperate for optimization strategies beyond "just eat meat." The community is literally begging for Dr. Chaffee to weigh in.

→ Anthony Chaffee went contrarian at exactly the right moment - addressing why people QUIT carnivore (instead of why they should start) generated 3K+ likes because everyone's thinking it but nobody's saying it.

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

Last week was all New Year optimism and "starting fresh" content. This week? Reality hit. The conversation shifted hard from "how to start" to "why people quit" and "how to actually sustain this." The dairy debate exploded from background noise to main event, with Chaffee drawing a line in the sand while others are quietly suggesting maybe cheese isn't the enemy if it keeps you compliant.

The gut health obsession from last week just intensified - fermented foods, sauerkraut juice, and bone broth are now competing with steak for airtime. And here's the shift nobody's talking about: budget carnivore went from practical tip to full-on movement. Multiple creators are actively fighting the "expensive ribeye lifestyle" stereotype because they know it's killing adoption.

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

Comments are getting spicy. Dr. Layne Norton's fiber defense videos are bringing carnivore advocates out in force, with "oxalate dumping" becoming the rally cry against mainstream nutrition science. But internally, there's tension too - people are genuinely confused about whether they should eliminate dairy or use it as a sustainability tool. The most engaged threads aren't about success stories anymore; they're people troubleshooting why carnivore isn't working and comparing notes on B1 supplementation. Translation: the honeymoon phase is over, and people want solutions, not inspiration.

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

Watch for the strict vs. flexible carnivore split to widen into a full schism. As more creators address "why people quit," expect counter-content defending sustainable approaches with dairy and flexibility. The gut health angle is about to get crowded - if sauerkraut juice can generate 1,779 comments, every creator with a fermentation opinion is about to upload. And OptimalHealth's mainstream success will spawn imitators trying to ride the seed oil outrage wave to viral status.
