CARNIVORE WEEKLY INSIDER
Week of 2025-12-26
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subject: Your coffee habit might be sabotaging your B1 levels (and other carnivore secrets nobody's talking about)

Here's something wild: the same community that spent months debating "is butter a carb?" is now having philosophical arguments about sauerkraut juice in the comments section. Welcome to carnivore in 2025, where we've moved past "should I eat only meat?" and landed firmly in "how do I actually make this work forever?"

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

5.7 million views this week, but here's what matters: OptimalHealth absolutely dominated with 4.5M views on a video about India's dietary changes—proving carnivore-adjacent content travels WAY further than strict carnivore preaching. Meanwhile, HomeSteadHow's sauerkraut video pulled 1,779 comments, which tells you exactly where the community's head is at: optimization mode. People aren't asking "does carnivore work?" anymore. They're asking "what comes after the first 90%?"

🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS

• OptimalHealth is playing a different game—mainstream-friendly content (butter coffee, seed oils) that sneaks carnivore principles to millions without triggering the "extreme diet" alarm bells

• HomeSteadHow cracked the code: tell people carnivore got you "90% there" and watch engagement explode. Turns out everyone's got that last 10% they can't shake.

• Steak and Butter Gal's protein dip recipe hit 172K views, reminding us that practical recipe content still crushes philosophical debates about dietary purity

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

Same topics as last week, but with MORE intensity. The dairy debate isn't cooling down—Dr. Chaffee doubled down on "dairy makes people quit" while comment sections are full of "butter saved my carnivore journey" testimonials. The B1/coffee connection Dr. Ken Berry raised is spreading like wildfire because it hits everyone's sacred cow (pun intended). And gut health optimization through fermented foods has gone from fringe theory to the hottest debate in carnivore right now. What changed? Nothing new dropped—these conversations are just deepening. The community's camping on these questions because they don't have clear answers yet.

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

Comments this week reveal something fascinating: people are WAY more interested in what to ADD than what to eliminate. HomeSteadHow's sauerkraut video sparked 1,779 comments of "wait, is this allowed?" and "this fixed my digestion!" OptimalHealth's butter coffee video got enthusiastic testimonials about sustained energy. Even Dr. Chaffee's "why people quit" video turned into a debate about whether strictness or sustainability matters more. The vibe? Less dogma, more experimentation. People want permission to optimize.

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

Watch for the gut health conversation to keep expanding—fermented foods are the tip of the iceberg. If creators are smart, they'll tackle the "sustainable carnivore" angle that HomeSteadHow and Steak and Butter Gal are mining: how to make this work in real life, long-term, without going broke or losing your mind. And somebody needs to properly address the B1/coffee thing before the entire community gives up their morning ritual in a panic.
