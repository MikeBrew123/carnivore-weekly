CARNIVORE WEEKLY INSIDER
Week of 2025-12-30
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subject: The New Year stampede is here (and everyone's making the same mistake)

Hey friend,

Dr. Chaffee and Steak and Butter Gal both dropped "If I Started Carnivore in 2026" videos within days of each other. That's not a coincidence. That's the entire creator community bracing for the January resolution wave.

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

We tracked 285K views across carnivore content this week, but here's what matters: the top three videos ALL focus on beginner mistakes and nutrient fears. That tells me creators are watching their DMs fill up with "I'm starting January 1st, what should I know?" messages. Dr. Chaffee's blueprint alone pulled 88K views and 951 comments, most of them from people who've already failed once and don't want to mess it up again.

🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS

→ Anthony Chaffee MD dominates at 88K views with his beginner blueprint. His "eat the damn fat" quote is already circulating in comments everywhere.

→ Ken Berry timing is perfect: drops a B1/thiamine video right when newbies are spiraling about nutrient completeness. 68K views from worried beef-only folks wondering if they need pork.

→ Max German playing cleanup crew with 34K views on "STOP doing THIS!" Content about what ruins carnivore results always pops in late December. People want to know what killed their last attempt.

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

The vibe shifted HARD into hand-holding mode. Last week had variety and experimentation. This week? Pure survival guides.

Three creators independently decided THIS is the week to publish comprehensive starter blueprints. They're all answering the same fears: Is beef-only enough? Why am I not losing weight? How much fat is too much fat?

The weight loss stall conversation is heating up, and I'm noticing something interesting. Courtney Luna and Max German are both tackling it, but from opposite angles. One's talking metabolic healing timeframes, the other's talking protein-to-fat ratios. The community doesn't have consensus on this yet, which means we'll see more content battling it out in January.

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

Comment sections are PACKED with former vegetarians right now. I counted at least a dozen testimonials from plant-based converts talking about reversed MS symptoms, healed IBS, and energy they haven't felt in years.

But there's also real anxiety bubbling up. People asking: "How long does oxalate dumping last?" and "My eyes are literally producing crystals, is this normal?" The detox symptom questions are getting gnarly, and honestly, creators aren't addressing them enough.

The recipe content surge tells another story. When Steak and Butter Gal posts carnivore pancakes and ice cream, that's not about nutrition. That's about January 15th when New Year motivation dies and people need a reason not to quit.

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

Watch for electrolyte content to explode in week two of January. That's when the adaptation crash hits and everyone simultaneously googles "carnivore flu."

I'm also expecting the weight loss stall debate to get spicy. The community hasn't settled whether it's calories, fat ratios, or "trust the process" healing time. Some creator is going to stake a controversial position and it'll pop off.

And keep an eye on Dr. Shawn Baker. His viral-style "meat is the problem?" content got strong engagement with way fewer views. He might be testing a new format.

See you next Monday with whoever survives the New Year chaos.
