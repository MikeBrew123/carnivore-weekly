CARNIVORE WEEKLY INSIDER
Week of 2025-12-30
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subject: The honesty wave is here (and it's about time)

Something shifted this week. The carnivore internet stopped selling perfect transformations and started admitting something everyone was already thinking: this isn't always easy, and that's okay.

**📊 BY THE NUMBERS**

Ten videos pulled in 274K views this week, but here's what matters more than the totals: engagement rates are through the roof on the vulnerability content. Courtney Luna's "honest conversation" got just 2,796 views but sparked 59 deeply personal comments and 371 likes. That's a 13% engagement rate in a world where 2% is solid. People are starving for real talk, not just another "eat steak, feel amazing" testimonial.

**🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS**

• Anthony Chaffee continues his dominance with 91K views on his 2026 blueprint. The guy knows how to time content drops, hitting right when New Year motivation peaks. Smart.

• Ken Berry's pork video (74K views) is quietly becoming the reference guide everyone bookmarks. Finally, someone said out loud what the data shows: beef-only isn't the flex some people think it is.

• Steak and Butter Gal pulling 71K views with her "food as fuel not entertainment" frame. That mindset shift is landing hard with people who've tried every other diet and failed.

**🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING**

Here's the thing: the topics haven't changed week to week, but the *tone* absolutely has. 

We're seeing the same blueprint content and nutrient discussions, but now creators are wrapping it in permission to be imperfect. The "all or nothing" era is dying. Max German's mistake breakdown got 401 comments of people sharing their struggles openly. Anthony Chaffee's oxalate dumping explanation gave people a framework to understand why they feel like garbage without blaming themselves or the diet.

The shift? From "do carnivore perfectly" to "here's how to do carnivore sustainably." That's huge. That's the difference between a trend and a lifestyle.

**💭 COMMUNITY PULSE**

The comments sections this week read like support groups in the best possible way. Someone on Courtney's video admitted they're "90% carnivore" and got flooded with "me too" responses instead of judgment. A 20-year vegetarian shared their IBS diagnosis story on Steak and Butter Gal's video and received genuine empathy, not evangelism.

Question popping up everywhere: "Am I doing this wrong if I still feel tired?" The answer creators are finally giving: maybe you need more fat, maybe you need pork for B1, maybe you're dumping oxalates. Here are fixes, not failures.

**🔮 LOOKING AHEAD**

Watch for more nutrient-specific deep dives. Ken Berry opened the door with B1, and I'd bet money we see vitamin A, magnesium, and zinc content in the next few weeks. The community's ready to graduate from "eat meat" to "eat the *right* meats for your specific gaps."

Also keeping an eye on whether this honesty wave continues or if we snap back to transformation porn when engagement dips. Really hoping it sticks.

**[Marcus here for a sec]** From a growth perspective, this authenticity play is genius even if it's not calculated. The creators leaning into "I'm not perfect either" are building trust that converts to long-term audience retention. Courtney's tiny view count but massive engagement rate? That's a quality audience that'll show up for everything she posts. That's more valuable than viral vanity metrics.
