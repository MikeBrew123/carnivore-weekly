CARNIVORE WEEKLY INSIDER
Week of 2025-12-26
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subject: The carnivore community just discovered its "missing 10%"

The most engaged video this week wasn't about steak. It wasn't about losing 100 pounds. It was about fermented cabbage juice getting people to "perfect poops." Welcome to optimization season.

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

OptimalHealth went absolutely nuclear this week with 4.5M views on a single video about India's dietary transformation—proof that seed oil content still prints views when you hit the algorithm right. But here's what's really interesting: the hardcore carnivore creators are stuck in the 70K-170K range while carnivore-adjacent content is eating their lunch. The community might be maturing, but it's also fragmenting.

🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS

→ OptimalHealth is playing a different game entirely, racking up 5.3M views with butter coffee and seed oil takes while everyone else fights over dairy debates

→ HomeSteadHow cracked the code with sauerkraut juice (1,779 comments!), proving that carnivore folks are desperate for that final 10% of optimization

→ Dr. Chaffee tackled "why people quit" head-on and pointed the finger at dairy—bold move that has the comments section in full debate mode

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

Last week everyone was hyped about "starting fresh in 2026." This week? They're asking why their fresh start already failed. The vibe shifted from aspirational to troubleshooting FAST. Gut health completely dominated—fermented foods, bone broth, B1 deficiency—while the dairy debate intensified from "should I include it?" to "is this why I'm quitting?" Dr. Layne Norton also showed up to poke the bear about fiber, which always gets the carnivore community spicy in the comments. The budget carnivore angle is holding strong though, with multiple creators pushing ground beef over the "ribeye lifestyle" myth.

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

People are getting real about adherence struggles, and creators are finally meeting them there. The most telling sign? Dr. Chaffee's "why people quit" video sparked way more honest discussion than the usual transformation porn. Comments are full of folks admitting dairy makes them feel like crap but they can't imagine life without cheese. Meanwhile, the sauerkraut juice crowd is treating fermented foods like they just discovered fire—lots of "why didn't anyone tell me this sooner?" energy.

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

Watch for the dairy debate to explode in January when New Year's carnivores hit their first plateau. The gut health optimization trend isn't slowing down—expect more creators to jump on fermented foods, bone broth protocols, and microbiome content. And if OptimalHealth keeps pulling millions of views with carnivore-adjacent content, other creators might start hedging their bets beyond strict nose-to-tail messaging.
