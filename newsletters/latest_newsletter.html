                    Subject: The Great Carnivore Vanishing Act of New Year's Week

Hey friend,

Sarah here. You know what's wild? Our carnivore creators went completely dark last week while plant-based channels racked up millions of views. A refried beans video is literally the top search result for "carnivore diet" right now.

Let me tell you why that's either the worst thing I've seen... or the biggest opportunity of 2026.

                <div class="section-content">
                    Zero. That's how many carnivore videos hit YouTube in the past 7 days. Meanwhile, The Plant Slant (yes, a plant-based channel) pulled 1.2M views with casual cooking shorts. They showed up during the holiday week. Our community didn't. And now the algorithm thinks beans are what people searching "carnivore diet" actually want to see.

                    Chloe jumping in here. There are no movers this week because nobody moved. That's the headline.

• Plant-based creators stayed active and are entering January with hot algorithms
• Carnivore YouTube took a collective vacation during the most strategic week of the year
• The one video ranking for our keywords? 27K likes on beans. BEANS.

This is what losing looks like, friends.

                    Marcus here with the strategic view. Let's compare week-over-week: last week we had zero content, this week we have zero content. The trend? Radio silence at exactly the wrong moment.

Here's what actually happened. Everyone assumed the week between Christmas and New Year's didn't matter. But search interest doesn't take holidays. People googling "carnivore diet" right now (hello, resolution season is starting) are finding competing content because we're not posting.

The Plant Slant figured this out. Short, casual, relatable content with personality. They commented on their own video within seconds. They treated the "dead week" like prime real estate.

                    Sarah back. Here's what I'm seeing in DMs and comments across platforms: people are READY for January. They're asking about meal prep, shopping lists, and how to start. They're searching YouTube right now.

But when they search, they're not finding fresh carnivore content. They're finding whatever the algorithm serves up from channels that stayed active. We're losing new community members before they even find us.

                    This week is make or break. Anyone posting carnivore content in the next 72 hours will rank easily because the competition is still asleep. The New Year's resolution wave is building, and it peaks around January 7-10.

If you're a creator reading this: batch record today. Post shorts daily. Be casual, be relatable, show your actual meals. The bar is on the floor right now, and the audience is searching.

🎯 FINAL WORD

The carnivore community just handed plant-based creators a free week of algorithm momentum heading into resolution season. Don't let it become two weeks.

Stay hungry,
