CARNIVORE WEEKLY INSIDER
Week of 2025-12-30
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subject: The Fat-to-Protein War of 2026 Has Begun 🥩

The carnivore community just spent the holidays arguing about the same thing that's tanked more diets than cheat days: how much fat you actually need to eat. And the timing? *Chef's kiss* – because January is about to flood the space with confused beginners who think chicken breast counts as carnivore.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

We tracked 285K views across the top carnivore creators this week, and here's what's wild: THREE separate channels released "If I Started Carnivore in 2026" videos within 72 hours of each other. Anthony Chaffee won that race with 88K views and a simple message everyone's quoting: "Eat the damn fat." The coordinated timing isn't coincidence – these creators know January is their Super Bowl, and they're positioning NOW to catch the resolution crowd before they screw it up with lean meat and calorie counting.

🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS

→ **Dr. Anthony Chaffee** took the crown this week (88K views) by saying what everyone's thinking: stop overthinking it. His full blueprint video generated 951 comments, many from former vegans sharing MS reversal stories. That's the content that converts skeptics.

→ **Ken Berry snuck in** with a sleeper hit about pork being the B1 king (68K views). Smart play – he's answering the "but what about nutrients?" concern before beginners even Google it.

→ **Max German's calling out mistakes** (34K views) and getting spicy about it. His protein-to-fat ratio warnings are creating comment wars, which means he's hitting a nerve. Good for engagement, even better for addressing why people plateau.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

This week vs last week? Honestly, it's the same conversation getting LOUDER. The 2026 blueprint content that started trickling out last week just hit critical mass. But here's the shift worth watching: nutrient completeness fears are creeping up the priority list. 

Ken Berry's B1/pork video signals something important – the community's maturing past "just eat steak" into "how do I actually optimize this long-term?" Meanwhile, weight loss stalls are becoming the uncomfortable truth no one wanted to discuss during the honeymoon phase. Courtney Luna and Max German both tackled it this week, and the comment sections are FULL of people admitting they're stuck after initial success.

The oxalate dumping conversation is also heating up, especially from plant-based converts. People are reporting some genuinely weird symptoms (crystals in eyes?!) and need reassurance they're not dying.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

The comments this week reveal a massive wave of 30-90 day carnivores hitting their first real challenge: boredom and stalls. Recipe content is surging as a direct response – people want carnivore pancakes and ice cream because eating ribeyes forever sounds better in theory than practice. 

The other big vibe? Former vegetarians are LOUD right now, sharing dramatic health turnarounds and basically becoming the movement's best evangelists. One commenter on Chaffee's video called their previous plant-based life "slow suicide" which... tells you everything about the energy in these communities.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

Watch for the beginner surge to peak in the next 2-3 weeks as New Year's resolutions kick in. The creators who win January will be the ones who can hold someone's hand through week two when the adaptation symptoms hit and Taco Bell sounds like heaven. 

Also keep an eye on the fat-vs-protein debate – it's going to define Q1 2026. This isn't just academic; it's the difference between people succeeding or rage-quitting back to "balanced" diets.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The blueprint wars have officially started, and the stakes are high: whoever captures the resolution crowd now owns their results for the year.
