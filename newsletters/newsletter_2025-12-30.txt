CARNIVORE WEEKLY INSIDER
Week of 2025-12-30
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subject: The fat-to-protein ratio is breaking friendships 👀

Hey friend,

**Sarah here.** I watched 951 people argue in YouTube comments this week about whether to "eat the damn fat" or go leaner, and honestly? This civil war might be more intense than the carnivore vs. vegan debates.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

285K total views this week, but here's what nobody's telling you: the community has completely shifted from "eat meat, heal yourself" to "here's exactly how NOT to screw this up." Dr. Chaffee's beginner blueprint pulled 88K views. Not because people are curious about carnivore anymore. They're desperate to restart after failing the first time. That's the real story in these numbers.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS

**Marcus jumping in.** Let me break down who's actually moving the needle:

→ **Anthony Chaffee MD** is absolutely dominating with 88K views on his 2026 blueprint. The timing is perfect. Dropped it right when New Year resolution energy is peaking. Smart positioning.

→ **Ken Berry** pulled 68K talking about... pork? In a beef-dominated space, he's addressing the elephant (or pig) in the room about B1 deficiency. Bold move that's paying off.

→ **Max German** is the dark horse here. 33K views with a "you're doing it wrong" angle that has people in the comments confessing their mistakes like it's therapy.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

**Chloe here with the tea.** This week is ALL about the "restart energy" and frankly, it's fascinating to watch. 

Last week? People were sharing success stories and celebrating wins. This week? Complete 180. Everyone's in troubleshooting mode.

The fat-versus-protein debate has EXPLODED. Max German says you're eating too much protein, Steak and Butter Gal says add more fat from day one, and half the comments are people realizing they've been eating chicken breast like it's 2015. The "lean protein for weight loss" crowd is having an identity crisis right now.

And can we talk about the B1 conversation? Ken Berry dropped a bomb suggesting beef-only might not be enough, and suddenly everyone's questioning whether they need to add pork. In a community that prides itself on "just eat meat," this nuance is making people VERY uncomfortable.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

**Back to Sarah.** The comments section is where the real gold is this week. 

Former vegans are flooding in with transformation stories (multiple people reversing MS symptoms, which is wild), but they're also reporting ROUGH oxalate dumping experiences. One person mentioned "crystals in eyes" and suddenly everyone's comparing detox horror stories.

The weight loss stall conversation is getting spicy. People are finally admitting that yes, some folks DON'T lose weight on carnivore, and the usual "just trust the process" advice isn't cutting it anymore. There's a genuine debate happening about whether calories matter, and it's refreshing to see the community mature past dogma.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

**Marcus with the forecast.** Watch for the "30-day carnivore challenge" content to explode in early January. The infrastructure is being built right now with all these beginner guides.

Also keep an eye on the nutrient completeness conversation. Ken Berry just opened Pandora's box with the B1 discussion, and I guarantee other creators will start addressing vitamin concerns to differentiate themselves.

The recipe content surge tells me people are hitting the 90-day mark and getting bored. Expect more "carnivore comfort food" content as creators fight to keep people from quitting.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Sarah closing us out.** Here's what matters: This community is getting more sophisticated. People aren't just asking "should I eat meat?" anymore. They're asking "how do I optimize this long-term?" That's maturity.

The full breakdowns, trending topics, and every video summary are waiting for you at carnivoreweekly.com.

Stay meaty,
Sarah, Chloe & Marcus

P.S. Seriously though, are you eating enough fat? The comments suggest probably not. 🥩
