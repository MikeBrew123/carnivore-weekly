CARNIVORE WEEKLY INSIDER
Week of 2025-12-26
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Subject: The Great Dairy Divide (and why OptimalHealth just hit 4.5M views)

The carnivore community is having an identity crisis, and it's getting messy.

On one side: Dr. Chaffee saying dairy is why you're quitting. On the other: creators arguing that cheese and butter are the only reason people stick around long enough to see results. Meanwhile, someone just got 1,779 comments talking about their poop after drinking sauerkraut juice. Welcome to Monday.

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

OptimalHealth absolutely demolished the competition this week with 4.5 million views on a single video about India's diet transformation—that's more views than every other carnivore creator combined got this month. We're talking 5.7M total views across just 11 videos, with OptimalHealth claiming 93% of that traffic. The carnivore community might be niche, but when the message hits right (seed oils are poison, traditional fats are good), it goes mainstream FAST.

🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS

→ OptimalHealth is playing a different game entirely—viral short-form content bringing 5.3M eyeballs to carnivore-adjacent ideas. Their bulletproof coffee video pulled another 819K views. They've cracked the algorithm.

→ HomeSteadHow's sauerkraut juice video (157K views, 1,779 comments) proves the community is hungry for optimization tactics beyond "just eat meat." The engagement rate here is insane—people are practically begging for solutions to digestive issues.

→ Steak and Butter Gal's dip recipe hit 172K views, making her the top performer in strict carnivore content. Recipe innovation is clearly a winning lane when everyone's tired of plain steak.

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

Last week everyone was focused on "starting fresh in 2025" content. This week? The cracks are showing. The conversation shifted hard from inspiration to retention—why do people quit, what makes this sustainable, and how do you optimize when basic carnivore isn't enough?

The gut health fermented foods discussion that started brewing last week just exploded, but here's the twist: it's exposing a philosophical divide. Are we about animal foods only, or are we about results? Dr. Chaffee is drawing harder lines (no dairy, period), while the masses are gravitating toward HomesteadHow's "carnivore got me 90% there, but this one drink changed everything" approach. The purity vs. pragmatism battle is THE underlying tension right now.

And Dr. Layne Norton is still out here defending fiber, creating absolute chaos in comment sections with oxalate dumping debates. The mainstream nutrition world isn't ignoring carnivore anymore—they're actively fighting it.

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

The comments reveal something crucial: people are stuck in the messy middle. They've seen initial results, lost some weight, feel better than before—but they're not getting the miraculous transformations they see in testimonials. That's why the sauerkraut juice video resonated so hard. That's why the "why people quit" video got 358 comments debating whether dairy is friend or foe.

The budget carnivore conversation is gaining real traction too, with people relieved to hear they don't need grass-fed ribeyes to succeed. Ground beef is having a moment as the people's champion.

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

Watch for the fermented foods debate to intensify—this isn't going away. If HomesteadHow's engagement is any indicator, we're about to see a wave of "carnivore plus one thing" content from creators trying to solve the adherence problem. The strict carnivore advocates will push back hard.

Also keep an eye on whether OptimalHealth's viral success inspires other creators to go broader with carnivore-adjacent messaging. The India video proved there's a massive audience for "traditional foods good, industrial seed oils bad" content that doesn't require full carnivore commitment.

The data, the debates, and every video that actually matters—it's all analyzed and waiting for you at carnivoreweekly.com.
