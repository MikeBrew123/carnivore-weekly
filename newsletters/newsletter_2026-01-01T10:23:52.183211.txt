Subject: The carnivore content drought nobody's talking about

Hey friend,

Sarah here. Something weird is happening on YouTube, and it's not good for us.

For two weeks straight, plant-based creators are literally owning the "carnivore diet" search term. I'm talking refried beans videos showing up as top results when people search for carnivore content. This isn't a glitch. It's a warning sign.

📊 BY THE NUMBERS

Zero. That's how many carnivore videos our tracking picked up this week. Same as last week. Meanwhile, The Plant Slant's bean video sitting in our search results has 367K views and a 7.3% like ratio. They're eating our lunch while we're... where exactly? The data suggests our creators either took an extended holiday break or got comfortable. Neither is great.

🚀 MOVERS & SHAKERS

This section hurts to write because there's nothing to report. No breakout videos. No surprise comebacks. No wins to celebrate. The leaderboard is empty, and that should make every carnivore creator reading this uncomfortable.

🔥 WHAT'S TRENDING

Here's the trend: silence. Week one looked like a holiday slowdown. Week two confirms it's a pattern. The opposition isn't taking breaks, they're filling the void we're leaving. New Year is prime time for diet content. People are searching "carnivore diet" right now, trying to figure out their 2026 health plan, and we're handing them plant-based counter content by default.

Marcus here. Let me be blunt about the business reality.

When your audience searches for you and finds your competition instead, you lose more than views. You lose authority. Every day without consistent carnivore content in the top results is another day someone discovers this lifestyle through a critical lens first. That's a trust gap that costs real money and real impact.

The creators who show up in Q1 will own the algorithm for months. That's how YouTube works. Early momentum compounds.

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

Back to Chloe. I wish I had spicy comment section drama to share, but I can't analyze what doesn't exist. The community is out there, definitely searching and hungry for content. They're just not finding us. That's the pulse right now: demand without supply. It's actually the perfect storm for any creator willing to post consistently this month.

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

If this content gap continues another week, we're looking at a systemic problem. But here's the flip side: whoever breaks the silence first with solid New Year carnivore content will absolutely dominate. I'm watching for "30 Day Carnivore Challenge" content, "Carnivore for Beginners 2026" explainers, and transformation stories. Those always pop in January.

The data doesn't lie, and right now it's screaming opportunity for the creators who hear it.

P.S. If you're a creator reading this, please take it as the wake-up call it's meant to be. And if you're just here for the health tips, know that we're pushing hard to get better content in front of you. You deserve more than bean videos when you search for meat.
