Here's something wild: the same community that spent months debating "is butter a carb?" is now having philosophical arguments about sauerkraut juice in the comments section. Welcome to carnivore in 2025, where we've moved past "should I eat only meat?" and landed firmly in "how do I actually make this work forever?"

The dairy debate isn't cooling down—Dr. Chaffee doubled down on "dairy makes people quit" while comment sections are full of "butter saved my carnivore journey" testimonials. The B1/coffee connection Dr. Ken Berry raised is spreading like wildfire because it hits everyone's sacred cow (pun intended).

💭 COMMUNITY PULSE

Comments this week reveal something fascinating: people are WAY more interested in what to ADD than what to eliminate. HomeSteadHow's sauerkraut video sparked 1,779 comments of "wait, is this allowed?" and "this fixed my digestion!" OptimalHealth's butter coffee video got enthusiastic testimonials about sustained energy. Even Dr. Chaffee's "why people quit" video turned into a debate about whether strictness or sustainability matters more. The vibe? Less dogma, more experimentation. People want permission to optimize.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🔮 LOOKING AHEAD

Watch for the gut health conversation to keep expanding—fermented foods are the tip of the iceberg. If creators are smart, they'll tackle the "sustainable carnivore" angle that HomeSteadHow and Steak and Butter Gal are mining: how to make this work in real life, long-term, without going broke or losing your mind. And somebody needs to properly address the B1/coffee thing before the entire community gives up their morning ritual in a panic.
