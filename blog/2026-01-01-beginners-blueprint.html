            <h2>The Beginner's Blueprint: Start to Adaptation</h2>

<p>If you're starting carnivore in January, you're joining thousands of people doing the same thing. And if you're reading this, you probably have questions: What should I actually eat? How long does adaptation take? What's normal? What's a red flag?</p>

<p>I'm going to give you the blueprint that works. Not theoretical. Not optimized for Instagram. Just what actually works for people who want to start carnivore without overthinking it.</p>

<h2>Week 1: The Honeymoon Phase</h2>

<p>Your first week on carnivore will probably feel incredible. You'll notice:</p>

<ul>
<li>Energy spike (sometimes within hours)</li>
<li>Mental clarity and focus</li>
<li>Hunger disappears or gets much quieter</li>
<li>Brain fog clears</li>
<li>Better sleep (usually)</li>
</ul>

<p>This is real. But here's what's actually happening: You're not just losing water weight. Your blood sugar is stable for the first time in years. Your insulin isn't spiking. Your body isn't chasing carb crashes. That clarity you feel? That's what normal is supposed to feel like.</p>

<p>Enjoy this week. You've earned it. But don't get too attached to how you feel, because week two is different.</p>

<h2>Week 2-3: The Adaptation Wall</h2>

<p>By day 8-10, you might feel flat. Your energy dips. You're tired. Your body might feel weird. This is when most people quit.</p>

<p>Here's what's happening: Your metabolism is shifting. You've been running on glucose for your whole life. Your body had a system for that. Now you're asking it to run on fat. Your mitochondria are upregulating fat-burning enzymes. This takes time. Your body is literally rebuilding how it produces energy.</p>

<p>This is normal. It's not that carnivore doesn't work. It's adaptation. And it usually lasts 2-3 weeks, sometimes longer if you're metabolically damaged from years of carbs.</p>

<p>What helps during this phase:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Salt:</strong> More than you think. At least a teaspoon daily, more if you're active or in a cold climate. This is the number one thing people get wrong.</li>
<li><strong>Beef fat:</strong> Your energy comes from fat, not protein. If you're eating lean meat only, you're going to feel terrible. Rib eyes, ground beef with fat, fatty cuts. 70-80% of your calories should be from fat.</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> You're losing electrolytes. Drink water. Not excessive, but enough. Your urine should be pale yellow.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Your body is working hard on adaptation. Let it. Go to bed early if you need to.</li>
</ul>

<p>If after 3 weeks you still feel terrible, it's almost always one of the above. Not the diet.</p>

<h2>Week 4+: You've Adapted</h2>

<p>By week 4, most people feel noticeably better. Your energy stabilizes. You're sleeping well. You're not thinking about food constantly. Your cravings are gone or minimal. This is the baseline. This is what you're building toward.</p>

<p>From here, the changes are slower and deeper. Your body is healing. Your inflammation is dropping. Your metabolic markers are improving. But these take weeks and months to show up. Don't expect dramatic daily changes.</p>

<h2>What You're Actually Eating</h2>

<p>This is simple, but people overcomplicate it:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Meat:</strong> Beef, pork, lamb, chicken. Fatty cuts. Any part of the animal.</li>
<li><strong>Fish:</strong> Salmon, mackerel, sardines. Fatty fish is better.</li>
<li><strong>Eggs:</strong> As many as you want.</li>
<li><strong>Organ meats:</strong> Liver, kidney, heart. Optional but nutrient-dense (see our <a href="../../wiki.html#organ-meats">organ meats guide</a>).</li>
<li><strong>Dairy (optional):</strong> Butter, cheese, full-fat dairy. Some people do better without it.</li>
<li><strong>Salt:</strong> Real salt. Sea salt, pink salt, kosher salt. Just salt.</li>
<li><strong>Water:</strong> Drink when thirsty.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's it. You don't need special supplements. You don't need to count macros. You don't need to optimize your meal timing. Eat when you're hungry. Stop when you're full. Season your food. Done.</p>

<p>The most common mistake: eating too much protein and not enough fat. Protein is 4 calories per gram. Fat is 9 calories per gram. You need fat for satiety, for energy, for hormone production. If you're eating chicken breast and lean beef, you're going to feel hungry and tired. Fix that first.</p>

<h2>What's Normal, What's Not</h2>

<p><strong>Normal in week 1-2:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fatigue or energy crashes</li>
<li>Mood shifts</li>
<li>Cravings (usually week 3-4)</li>
<li>Constipation or loose stools (usually fixes itself)</li>
<li>Headaches (usually from low salt or dehydration)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Not normal (and means you need to adjust):</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Extreme dizziness or fainting (add salt, increase water)</li>
<li>Severe GI distress lasting more than 2 weeks (you might need more fat, less volume)</li>
<li>Chest pain or palpitations (talk to your doctor; might be dehydration or electrolytes)</li>
<li>Severe muscle cramps after 2 weeks (definitely salt and electrolytes)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have pre-existing conditions like heart disease, kidney issues, or you're on medications, you need medical oversight. Your doctor should be in the loop, and they should understand what you're doing. If you're taking medications or have been diagnosed with any medical condition, you need individualized medical oversight. Don't make changes without consulting your doctor.</p>

<h2>Get Your Macros Right From the Start</h2>

<p>You don't need to count forever, but getting your macros right in week one prevents a lot of suffering in week two.</p>

<p>If you want personalized recommendations (based on your age, weight, activity level, and goals), our calculator gives you exact numbers in two minutes. You get either basic macros for free, or if you want more—including meal plans and a doctor's consultation script—we have a $9.99 pro plan that's worth it.</p>

<h2>Resources and Further Learning</h2>

<p>Start with these reference points:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../wiki.html#digestion">Digestion on carnivore</a> - What's normal, what's not</li>
<li><a href="../../wiki.html#salt-sodium">Salt and sodium</a> - Why it matters more than you think</li>
<li><a href="../../wiki.html#electrolytes">Electrolytes and cramps</a> - Prevention and fixes</li>
<li><a href="../../wiki.html#budget">Eating carnivore on a budget</a> - You don't need expensive meat</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<p>Carnivore is simple. Eat meat. Salt your food. Drink water. Get enough fat. That's the foundation.</p>

<p>Adaptation takes 2-4 weeks. It's normal to feel weird during this time. It's not normal to feel terrible after 4 weeks—usually means you need more salt or fat.</p>

<p>You don't need to be perfect. You need to be consistent. Consistency beats optimization every single time.</p>

<p>You've got this. And if you hit a wall, you know where to find answers.</p>
