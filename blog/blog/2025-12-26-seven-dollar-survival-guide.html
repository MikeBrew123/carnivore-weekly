<p>One of the biggest objections to carnivore is cost. "It's too expensive. I can't afford meat every day." Here's what that usually means: you're buying expensive meat.</p>



                <div class="tldr-box tldr-box--green">
                    <h3>TL;DR</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Carnivore doesn't have to be expensive. It can be cheaper than most standard diets. Here's how to do it on a budget.</li>
                        <li>Cheap, fatty, forgiving. Throw in a pot, cook slow, eat for days. A 3-pound chuck roast for $8 is a week of meals for one person.</li>

                </div>

<p>Carnivore doesn't have to be expensive. It can be cheaper than most standard diets. Here's how to do it on a budget.</p>

<h2>The Cheap Cuts That Work</h2>

<h3>Ground Beef ($3-5 per pound)</h3>

<p>The MVP of budget carnivore. Fatty ground beef (80/20 or 73/27) is nutrient-dense and versatile. Buy the bigger packages. They're cheaper per pound. 10-pound chubs at Costco run $3-3.50/lb.</p>

<h3>Chuck Roasts ($2-4 per pound)</h3>

<p>Cheap, fatty, forgiving. Throw in a pot, cook slow, eat for days. A 3-pound chuck roast for $8 is a week of meals for one person.</p>

<h3>Beef Liver ($2-4 per pound)</h3>

<p>Liver is cheap because people don't want it. More for you. Liver is more nutrient-dense than muscle meat. Freeze it. Eat it in smaller portions. A 1-pound package of beef liver is often $2-3.</p>

<h3>Chicken ($1.50-3 per pound)</h3>

<p>Chicken is cheap. Thighs are cheaper than breasts and have more fat. A rotisserie chicken is $5-7 and provides 3-4 meals.</p>

<h3>Canned Fish ($1-3 per can)</h3>

<p>Sardines and mackerel in cans are cheap, last forever, and are nutrient-dense. No prep. No cooking. $2 a meal if you buy on sale.</p>

<h3>Eggs ($2-4 per dozen)</h3>

<p>Eggs are protein and fat. Cheap. A dozen eggs is a week of breakfasts.</p>

<h2>Budget Carnivore Breakdown</h2>

<p>If you're targeting $2-3 per meal:</p>

                <blockquote class="pull-quote">
                    "One of the biggest objections to carnivore is cost. "It's too expensive. I can't afford meat every day." Here's what that usually means: you're buying expensive meat."
                </blockquote>



<p><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Eggs. 2-3 eggs, $0.50.</p>

<p><strong>Lunch:</strong> Ground beef. 1 pound of 80/20 beef, $3-4, two servings. $1.50-2 per serving.</p>

<p><strong>Dinner:</strong> Chuck roast or chicken thighs. $2-4 per serving depending on portion.</p>

<p><strong>Total:</strong> $4-8 per day if you're intentional about cheap cuts and bulk buying.</p>

<p>Compare that to most diets, and carnivore is actually cheaper.</p>

<h2>The Buying Strategy</h2>

<p>Buy what's on sale. Costco membership is $60/year and pays for itself in meat savings within two months if you buy in bulk. Shop the sales. Stock your freezer when prices are good.</p>

<p>Most grocery stores have meat sales every 2-3 weeks. Buy when ground beef hits $3/lb. Stock for three weeks. Skip it when it's $5/lb.</p>

<p>If you're buying online for bulk stocking, ButcherBox works for budget-conscious carnivores. Their bulk orders bring the per-pound cost down significantly. Not the cheapest option, but consistent quality at scale. <a href="https://butcherbox.pxf.io/Z6oVMR?utm_source=carnivore_weekly&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=seasonal_offer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" onclick="trackAffiliateClick('ButcherBox', this.href)">Check them out here.</a></p>

<p>Local butchers are still cheaper if you have them. But if you're serious about bulk ordering and consistency, ButcherBox is solid.</p>

<h2>What Not to Buy</h2>

<p>Grass-fed beef premium is usually $2-4 more per pound for negligible difference if you're on a budget. Grass-fed is fine, but it's not necessary. Regular beef works. Organic doesn't matter for carnivore (you're only eating the meat). Pricey cuts (ribeye, sirloin, filet) are great but not necessary. Chuck roast tastes better when cooked slow.</p>

<h2>Prep Strategy on a Budget</h2>

<p>Cook in bulk. Sunday: brown 5 pounds of ground beef, season with salt. Portion into containers. Eat from containers all week. Takes 30 minutes, saves you cooking every day.</p>

<p>Or: buy chuck roasts, throw in slow cooker for 8 hours. Meat falls apart. Eat for days. Minimal effort, minimal cost, maximum simplicity.</p>

<h2>The Math</h2>

<p>Eating 1.5-2 pounds of meat per day costs:</p>

<p>Ground beef at $3/lb: $4.50-6/day = $135-180/month</p>

<p>Chuck roast at $3/lb: $4.50-6/day = $135-180/month</p>

<p>Eggs and canned fish filling in: $100-150/month</p>

<p><strong>Total budget carnivore: $150-200/month for meat, $180-240/month total including any supplements.</strong></p>

<p>That's cheaper than most diets when you account for the fact that you're not buying processed snacks, restaurant food, or impulse purchases.</p>

<h2>Where People Overpay</h2>

<p>They buy expensive cuts when cheap cuts work just as well. They don't buy in bulk. They don't freeze and plan. They buy single-serving portions. They buy the premium organic grass-fed when regular works fine.</p>

<p>Budget carnivore isn't about sacrificing quality. It's about not paying premium prices for unnecessary extras.</p>

<h2>The Budget-Focused Take</h2>

<p>Carnivore can be one of the cheapest diets if you buy the right cuts, buy in bulk, and plan ahead. Ground beef, chuck roasts, chicken, eggs, and canned fish will keep you carnivore for $5-7 per day. That's cheaper than eating out once, and you'll feel better than any processed food diet.</p>
