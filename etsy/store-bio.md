## About Carnivore Weekly

We started this because we were frustrated.

The carnivore space is full of noise. Influencers selling you on miracle results. Fear-mongering about food. Everyone screaming about what's "toxic" this week. And if you want actual information backed by research? Good luck finding it buried under all the hype.

So we built what we wished existed: a place for real content, actual context, and zero BS.

We're a small team of health researchers, coaches, and community nerds based in Whistler, BC. Between us, we've got decades of experience studying nutrition, coaching clients through metabolic health challenges, and being way too deep in carnivore Reddit at 2am. We've used this way of eating to resolve our own health issues. We've watched others do the same. And we've seen what actually works versus what's just good marketing.

Our approach is simple: evidence over hype, data over drama. We don't pretend everything is settled science. We tell you what the research shows, what we've seen work in practice, and where we're still figuring things out. No guru energy. No fake certainty.

The products we make here grew out of that same philosophy. Useful tools. Practical resources. Things we actually wanted for ourselves and couldn't find anywhere else.

If you're looking for someone to sell you on a lifestyle, we're not it. If you want honest information and products that respect your intelligence, we're your people.
