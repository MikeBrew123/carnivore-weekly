CARNIVORE MACROS IN 5 MINUTES — DESKTOP PDF

I spent years overthinking macros. Tracking apps, conflicting advice, endless recalculations every time my weight changed. Then I figured out a simpler way.

This guide gives you a framework that actually sticks:

Protein = Your Anchor (this stays consistent — it protects your muscle)
Carbs = Your Ceiling (a hard limit, not a target to hit)
Fat = Your Dial (turn it up or down based on hunger and goals)

That's it. Three numbers. Once you understand why each one matters, you stop second-guessing yourself.

WHAT'S INSIDE
• Step-by-step calculator: BMR, activity level, and how to set a reasonable deficit
• Printable worksheet with space for your own notes
• A worked example so you can see exactly how the math works
• Sanity checks to catch common mistakes before they trip you up

THIS VERSION IS FOR
• Printing out and keeping by your fridge or desk
• People who like to write things down
• Desktop or tablet viewing

A NOTE ON EXPECTATIONS
This isn't a magic formula. It's a starting point. Your body will tell you what needs adjusting — this guide helps you understand what those signals mean.

CARNIVORE MACROS — COMPLETE BUNDLE

Plan at home. Reference on the go.

This bundle includes both versions of the macros guide — the printable desktop PDF for planning and note-taking, plus the phone-optimized version you can pull up anywhere.

THE FRAMEWORK THAT SIMPLIFIES EVERYTHING
• Protein = Your Anchor (consistent, non-negotiable)
• Carbs = Your Ceiling (a limit, not a goal)
• Fat = Your Dial (your main adjustment lever)

Once this clicks, you stop needing apps and trackers. You just know your numbers.

WHAT YOU GET (2 FILES)
• Desktop PDF: For printing, writing notes, working through calculations
• Mobile PDF: Phone-optimized for quick reference anywhere

HOW PEOPLE USE THIS
• Sunday: Print the desktop version, calculate your numbers, plan your week
• Tuesday at Costco: Check the mobile version for portion sizing
• Friday night out: Quick glance at your Daily Data Card before ordering

This bundle saves you a few dollars over buying separately, and having both versions just makes the whole system work better.

### Listing D — Complete Carnivore Starter Kit

Complete Carnivore Starter Kit (8 PDFs) | Macros + Food + First 30 Days | Dual-Device

**Price:** $29.97 → $39.97 after initial reviews

**Description**

THE COMPLETE CARNIVORE STARTER KIT

Most people who try carnivore quit in the first month. Not because it doesn't work — because nobody told them what to expect.

The headaches around day 3. The weird energy dip in week 2. The moment you realize you're bored of steak and need ideas. These are all solvable problems, but only if you know they're coming.

This kit gives you everything I wish I'd had when I started.

WHAT'S INCLUDED (8 FILES — DESKTOP + MOBILE VERSIONS OF EACH)

1. MACROS GUIDE
The Anchor/Ceiling/Dial framework. Calculate your protein, set your carb limit, understand how to adjust fat. Stop guessing.

2. FOOD FRAMEWORK
Not a meal plan — a decision framework. What to stock, what to rotate, how to keep things interesting. Removes the "what do I eat?" paralysis.

3. FIRST 30 DAYS GUIDE
Week-by-week breakdown of what to expect. Adaptation symptoms that scare people off are predictable. This tells you what's normal, what's not, and when to adjust.

4. TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE
Stalled weight loss. Persistent cravings. Energy crashes. Digestive changes. These have causes and solutions — this guide walks through the common ones.

WHY THIS WORKS
Each piece solves a specific problem:
• Macros give you targets so you're not guessing
• Food framework removes daily decision fatigue
• 30-day guide keeps you from quitting during adaptation
• Troubleshooting fixes problems that make people give up

Every file comes in both desktop (printable) and mobile (phone-optimized) versions.

Educational content based on research and experience — not medical advice. If you have health conditions, work with your doctor.
