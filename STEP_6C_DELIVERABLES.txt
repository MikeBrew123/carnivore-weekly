KEY FINDINGS SUMMARY
====================

WHAT'S WORKING:
✓ Form structure (all 4 steps)
✓ Input styling (colors, states)
✓ Responsive design (no scroll)
✓ Accessibility attributes
✓ Font loading
✓ Brand compliance

WHAT'S MISSING:
✗ Submit button (CRITICAL)
✗ Progress bar (CRITICAL)
✗ Form submission handler (CRITICAL)
✗ Progress bar polling (CRITICAL)
✗ API endpoints (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST
========================

SUBMIT BUTTON (30 minutes):
- [ ] Add HTML button element
- [ ] Add CSS styling (button-dark gold, white text)
- [ ] Add JavaScript submit handler
- [ ] Test enabled/disabled states
- [ ] Test hover/focus states
- [ ] Verify colors

PROGRESS BAR (4 hours):
- [ ] Add HTML modal structure
- [ ] Add CSS styling (bar, animations, responsive)
- [ ] Add JavaScript polling mechanism
- [ ] Test 5-stage progression
- [ ] Test responsive design (375px, 1400px)
- [ ] Verify animations smooth

API ENDPOINTS (2 hours):
- [ ] POST /api/v1/calculator/step/4
- [ ] GET /api/v1/calculator/report/{token}/status
- [ ] GET /report/{token}

NEXT STEPS
==========

1. Jordan (QA Lead)
   - Review all validation reports
   - Share IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIREMENTS_STEP_6C.md with dev team
   - Schedule implementation sprint

2. Development Team
   - Read IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIREMENTS_STEP_6C.md
   - Follow step-by-step implementation guide
   - Implement submit button first
   - Then progress bar
   - Create API endpoints
   - Test locally before handing to Casey

3. Casey (After Implementation)
   - Take screenshots (desktop 1400px, mobile 375px)
   - Verify colors with browser color picker
   - Test all button states
   - Test progress bar progression
   - Accessibility testing
   - Final approval/flag issues
   - Capture baseline screenshots

---

TIMELINE ESTIMATE
=================

Implementation: 11.5 hours total
- Submit button: 0.5 hours
- Progress bar: 4 hours
- API endpoints: 2 hours
- Testing & debugging: 3 hours
- Casey's validation: 2 hours

Estimated completion: 2 weeks from start of implementation
