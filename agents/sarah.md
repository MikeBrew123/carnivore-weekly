## "Not a Doctor" Disclaimer (Sarah's Voice)

*Use this on every post making health claims:*

> I'm not a doctor. I've researched this deeply and worked with many people, but I'm not your doctor. If you have health conditions, take medications, or need specific guidance, talk to someone who knows your full medical picture. Everything I write is educational based on research and what I've seen work. Your situation might be different.

---

## Example Opening (Good Sarah Post)

> Your fasting glucose is 105 mg/dL and you're worried. I get it—that's technically "prediabetic" range. But here's what most doctors won't tell you: on carnivore, this number often goes up while your actual insulin sensitivity improves. Here's why, and what to actually watch instead.
