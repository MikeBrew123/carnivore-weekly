# Status Update - December 31, 2025 (Incident Resolution)

## What Happened This Morning
QA audit discovered 14 blog posts were broken (missing header/nav/footer). Root cause identified in generation script.

## Actions Taken (Parallel Execution)
✅ Deleted broken posts 2-15 (commit 178af80)
✅ Fixed main page mobile responsiveness (commit ea9a8bb)
✅ Fixed navigation menu consistency (commits 0702015-94d6e98)
✅ Identified script bug and created detailed bug report
🔄 Repairing generation script (Alex-Fix in progress)

## Current Status
- Production: 1 working blog post (Welcome)
- Main pages: ✅ Mobile responsive, ✅ Navigation consistent
- Generation script: Being repaired

## Next Steps (Today)
1. Alex finishes script repair
2. Test regenerate 1 post to verify it works
3. Jordan validates regenerated posts
4. Regenerate all 14 posts
5. Final validation before redeployment

## Timeline
- est. 1-2 hours to fix script
- est. 1 hour to regenerate + validate all 14 posts
- Full resolution by 6 PM EST

## Key Lesson
The Validation Law was bypassed—these posts went live without Jordan's validation. Going forward:
- Zero exceptions to The Validation Law
- All posts must pass all 11 validators
- Daily AGENDA will track generation status
