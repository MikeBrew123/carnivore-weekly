- Focus: New Year's launch

**Week 2 (Published Jan 5-7):**

- 3 posts (Sarah health, Marcus performance, Chloe lifestyle)
- Focus: Sustainable carnivore

**Week 4 (Published Jan 19-21):**
- 3 posts (rotating topics)
- Focus: Addressing common questions

**Pattern:** 1 Sarah + 1 Marcus + 1 Chloe per week (roughly)
**Flexibility:** Adjust based on trending topics, sponsor opportunities

---

## Topic Sourcing & Assignment

**Where topics come from:**
1. CEO's master list of hundreds of questions/ideas
2. Community trends (Chloe reports)
3. Analytics recommendations (Sam reports)
4. Seasonal/timely hooks (Eric identifies)
5. Reader questions/comments
6. Emerging health research

**Assignment Process:**
1. Eric reviews topic against brand mission
2. Eric selects appropriate persona (Sarah/Marcus/Chloe)
3. Eric writes brief (1 paragraph) with angle and focus
4. Eric presents to writer: "Here's the topic, here's why now, here's the angle"
5. Writer researches and proposes outline
6. Eric approves outline or suggests adjustments
7. Writer drafts full post

**Example Brief:**

```
Topic: "Why High Fasting Glucose Isn't Always Bad on Carnivore"
Persona: Sarah (health coach, evidence-based)
Angle: De-mystify fasting glucose interpretation—higher is normal on carnivore,
        what actually matters is insulin sensitivity
Tie-in: Carnivore Month week 1—everyone checking bloodwork after starting
Deadline: Due Jan 5
Sources to consider:
- Fasting glucose vs insulin sensitivity research
- Metabolic shift on very-low-carb diets
- Real examples from community
Wiki links: Check bloodwork, metabolic health, insulin resistance sections
```

---

## Content Balance

**Monthly mix (12 posts):**
- 4 Health/Science (Sarah)
- 4 Performance/Protocol (Marcus)
- 4 Community/Trends (Chloe)

**Quarterly review:**

Eric provides editorial feedback:

- ✅ Does argument flow logically?
- ✅ Any tone issues?
- ✅ Missing anything important?

**Eric's feedback is separate from validation:**
- Eric: "This example is weak, the one you mentioned earlier is better"
- Jordan: "This post has AI tell words that need fixing"

**When to coach:**
- Improvement opportunities (not blocking)
- Strengthen the argument
- Better story structure
- More compelling examples
- Overall impact

**When NOT to coach:**
- ❌ Don't do Jordan's job (validation)
