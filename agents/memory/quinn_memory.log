[2025-12-31 14:45:00] CRITICAL - Blog Generation Script Failure
Category: System Incident
Situation: 14 blog posts generated without header/nav/footer/CSS
Issue: generate_blog_pages.py expects pre-existing HTML files but nothing creates them
Root Cause: Silent skip behavior on lines 58-59 of generate_blog_pages.py
Prevention: Script now loads content directly from blog_posts.json
Status: In Resolution - Alex fixing script, posts will be regenerated
Lessons Learned:
- Silent failures are worse than loud errors
- Test the generation pipeline end-to-end
- Always validate output before deployment
- The Validation Law must be enforced (no bypasses)

---

## DOCUMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES

Key Files to Maintain:
- INCIDENT_REPORT_2025-12-31.md (permanent record)
- DAILY_STATUS updates (team communication)
- Memory logs for all agents
- Process documentation

Critical Reminders:
- Document every incident for the record
- Use timestamps for all entries
- Maintain confidentiality of sensitive info
- Ensure team visibility of critical issues
- Track lessons learned

## TEAM VALIDATION LAW

Absolute requirement (no exceptions):
- All blog posts MUST pass Jordan's 11 validators
- All pages MUST pass Casey's visual validation
- All updates MUST be documented before deployment
- All incidents MUST be reported to CEO

## NEXT ACTIONS

Track these items until resolution:
1. Alex finishes script repair and tests 1 post
2. Jordan validates regenerated post
3. Regenerate remaining 13 posts
4. Final validation cycle
5. Deployment approval

[2026-01-02 05:45:00] CALCULATOR2-DEMO PROJECT STATUS
Category: Development Update
Project: Multi-step calculator rebuild (React + TypeScript)
Status: Form complete, Report API debugging needed

WHAT'S WORKING:
✅ Multi-step form (5 steps: basics, activity, goals, health, preferences)
✅ Real-time macro calculations (Mifflin-St Jeor, TDEE, macro splits)
✅ Mock payment modal (fully functional for testing)
✅ Progress bar with section checkmarks (13 sections)
✅ Form prefilled with detailed dummy data
✅ Beautiful animations (Framer Motion)
✅ Session management (48-hour recognition)
✅ All validations working
✅ TypeScript: 0 errors, builds cleanly

WHAT'S BROKEN:
❌ Report fetching from Supabase after API generation
  - Form submits → API called ✅
  - Cloudflare Worker generates report ✅ (presumably)
  - ReportViewer tries to fetch from Supabase ❌ FAILS
  - Error: "Failed to load report"

DEBUGGING NEEDED (MORNING):
1. Open in Chrome (NOT Safari - CORS issues)
2. Run full form → submit
3. Check browser console (F12 → Console)
4. Capture exact error message from ReportViewer
5. Check Supabase table schema (generated_reports table)
6. Verify API actually saves to Supabase
7. Fix ReportViewer query or schema mismatch

LIKELY CAUSES:
- Supabase table doesn't exist
- Column name mismatch (report_html vs report_content)
- RLS permissions issue on anon key
- CORS headers blocking
- API saving failed silently

DOCUMENTATION:
- Full status at: /Users/mbrew/Developer/carnivore-weekly/CALCULATOR2_STATUS.md
- Local server running: http://localhost:8000/calculator2-demo.html
- Entry point: /public/calculator2-demo.html
- Source: /calculator2-demo/src/

NEXT MORNING:
1. User will open in Chrome
2. Test form end-to-end
3. Capture console error from ReportViewer
4. Come back with exact error message
5. Fix Supabase integration based on error

STATUS: Ready to debug, just need error message from Chrome console
