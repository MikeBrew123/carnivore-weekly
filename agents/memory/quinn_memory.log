[2025-12-31 14:45:00] CRITICAL - Blog Generation Script Failure
Category: System Incident
Situation: 14 blog posts generated without header/nav/footer/CSS
Issue: generate_blog_pages.py expects pre-existing HTML files but nothing creates them
Root Cause: Silent skip behavior on lines 58-59 of generate_blog_pages.py
Prevention: Script now loads content directly from blog_posts.json
Status: In Resolution - Alex fixing script, posts will be regenerated
Lessons Learned:
- Silent failures are worse than loud errors
- Test the generation pipeline end-to-end
- Always validate output before deployment
- The Validation Law must be enforced (no bypasses)

## DOCUMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES

Key Files to Maintain:
- INCIDENT_REPORT_2025-12-31.md (permanent record)
- DAILY_STATUS updates (team communication)
- Memory logs for all agents
- Process documentation

Critical Reminders:
- Document every incident for the record
- Use timestamps for all entries
- Maintain confidentiality of sensitive info
- Ensure team visibility of critical issues
- Track lessons learned

## TEAM VALIDATION LAW

Absolute requirement (no exceptions):
- All blog posts MUST pass Jordan's 11 validators
- All pages MUST pass Casey's visual validation
- All updates MUST be documented before deployment
- All incidents MUST be reported to CEO

## NEXT ACTIONS

Track these items until resolution:
1. Alex finishes script repair and tests 1 post
2. Jordan validates regenerated post
3. Regenerate remaining 13 posts
4. Final validation cycle
5. Deployment approval
