# Incident Report: Blog Post Generation Failure

**Date:** 2025-12-31
**Severity:** CRITICAL (affected 14 of 15 blog posts)
**Status:** IN RESOLUTION
**Owner:** Alex (Developer) + Quinn (Record Keeper)

## Summary
14 blog posts (posts 2-15) were generated without essential HTML structure (header, navigation, footer, CSS), making them non-functional. Root cause identified as a flawed generation script that expected pre-existing files that were never created.

## Timeline
- 2025-12-30 20:12:50 - Blog system launched with 15 posts
- 2025-12-30 13:23 to 19:49 - Multiple failed attempts to fix via commits
- 2025-12-31 08:37:36 - Broken posts 2-15 deleted; script marked for fixing
- 2025-12-31 (current) - Comprehensive QA audit identified root cause

## Root Cause
File: `/scripts/generate_blog_pages.py` lines 54-69
- Script attempted to read pre-existing HTML files from `/public/blog/`
- No process in codebase creates these files
- Posts 2-15 silently skipped without error notification
- Welcome post (1) works because it was created with full template applied

## What Got Fixed Today

### 1. Cleanup (Alex-Remove)
- Deleted 14 broken blog posts from production
- Commit: 178af80
- Impact: Removed broken content from live site

### 2. Investigation (Alex-Investigate)
- Identified script flaw in generate_blog_pages.py
- Created detailed bug report with specific line numbers
- Root cause: Silent skip behavior on lines 58-59

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness (Alex-Mobile)
- Fixed horizontal scroll on 6 main pages
- Commit: ea9a8bb
- Pages fixed: Index, Wiki, Archive, Channels, Calculator, About
- Test: No scroll at 375px (iPhone SE viewport)

### 4. Navigation Consistency (Alex-Nav)
- Fixed missing Blog link on 4 pages
- Fixed missing About link on 2 pages
- Commits: 0702015 → 94d6e98
- Result: All pages now have identical menu

### 5. Script Repair (In Progress)
- Alex currently fixing generate_blog_pages.py
- Will replace file-reading logic with direct content loading
- Test: Regenerate 1 post to verify header/nav/footer/CSS present
- Then regenerate all 14 posts

## Next Steps
1. Alex finishes script repair and tests with 1 post
2. Jordan re-validates regenerated posts (all 11 validators)
3. Regenerate remaining 13 posts
4. Final QA check before deployment

## Prevention (Going Forward)
- The Validation Law will be strictly enforced (no more bypasses)
- All posts must pass 11 validators before deployment
- Generation script will have built-in validation
- Daily AGENDA will track post generation status

## Team Actions Required
- **Alex:** Continue with script repair
- **Jordan:** Stand by for validation of regenerated posts
- **Casey:** Stand by for visual validation
- **All:** Confirm receipt of this incident report
