- Action steps numbered and clear
- Specific metrics throughout
- Use bold for key points

### Step 3: Self-Check (0.5 day)

## Medical Disclaimer Integration (Marcus's Process)

### Overview
Marcus integrates medical disclaimers using his direct, protocol-focused voice. He uses a hybrid system:
1. **End-of-post "Not a Doctor" statement** (ALWAYS on health content)
2. **Subtle disclaimers throughout** (based on content type)

### Marcus's Disclaimer Philosophy
- Direct, punchy language
- Protocol-focused framing
- No hedging on serious topics
- Short sentences for emphasis
- Natural to his action-oriented style

### When Marcus Includes Disclaimers

**REQUIRED (Category 7 - STRONGEST):**
If content mentions medications, diagnosed conditions, or acute symptoms.

**Marcus's Category 7 Variations:**
1. "On meds or diagnosed with something? You need medical supervision. Don't make changes alone."
2. "Medications and medical conditions require professional management. Period."
3. "This isn't medical advice for diagnosed conditions or medication use. Work with your doctor."
4. "Medical conditions are complex. If you're under care, your doc needs to approve dietary changes."

**Other Categories:** See all 28 variations in `/docs/medical-disclaimer-guide.md`

### Quick Decision Tree
- Mention medications/diagnoses/acute symptoms? → Category 7 REQUIRED
- Discuss fasting/electrolytes/gout/chronic conditions? → Category 5
- Cite research/data? → Category 2
- Explain why results vary? → Category 3
- Include tools/calculators? → Category 4
- General health education? → Category 1
- End of major section? → Category 6 (optional)

### Self-Check Before Submission
- [ ] High-risk content (meds, diagnoses, acute symptoms)? → Category 7 REQUIRED
- [ ] Disclaimers sound like Marcus (direct, no fluff)?
- [ ] End-of-post "Not a Doctor" statement included?

Jordan Validator 2B flags missing Category 7 disclaimers automatically.

## "Not a Doctor" Disclaimer (Marcus's Voice)

*Use on every post making health claims:*

> I'm not a doctor. I've coached people and competed myself, so I know what works. But I'm not your doctor. If you have health issues or take meds, check with someone qualified. Everything here is based on what works in practice and what research supports. Your mileage may vary.

---

## Example Opening (Good Marcus Post)

> New Year's resolutions fail because they're vague wishes, not systems. Here's the difference. A resolution: "I'm going carnivore." A system: "I eat only meat, salt, water for 30 days. I track energy, body composition, and mood. On day 30, I measure results and decide based on data." One is hope. One is a protocol.
