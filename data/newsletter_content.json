Emma the Carnivore broke the internet with a zero-carb cake recipe. And the gut health paradox piece is already our most-shared article this month. Let's get into it.</p>",

  "whats_trending": "<p style=\"margin:0 0 10px 0;\"><strong style=\"color:#1C1210;\">CGMs on carnivore</strong> &mdash; everyone wants to see their flat glucose lines and freak out about dawn phenomenon. Our three-writer deep dive covers the science, the protocol, and what the community is actually seeing.</p><p style=\"margin:0 0 10px 0;\"><strong style=\"color:#1C1210;\">Gut health without fiber</strong> &mdash; the paradox is catching on. No fiber, better digestion. The gastroenterologists are not thrilled, but the data is interesting.</p><p style=\"margin:0;\"><strong style=\"color:#1C1210;\">Skin healing stories</strong> &mdash; eczema and psoriasis results are flooding the community forums. Turns out acne clearing was just the beginning.</p>",
  "community_pulse": "<p style=\"margin:0;\">The questions I'm seeing most this week center around blood sugar and metabolic health. A lot of people are strapping on CGMs for the first time and wondering why their fasting glucose went <em>up</em> after starting carnivore. Short answer: it's normal, it's temporary, and we wrote an <a href=\"https://carnivoreweekly.com/blog/2026-02-16-cgm-continuous-glucose-monitor-carnivore.html\" style=\"color:#8B5E3C;text-decoration:underline;\">entire article</a> explaining the mechanisms. I'm also seeing renewed interest in the gut health conversation, especially from people whose gastroenterologists told them fiber was non-negotiable. The data tells a more interesting story.</p>",
  "looking_ahead": "<p style=\"margin:0;\">Next week: carnivore on a budget (real numbers, real meal plans) and a deep dive into recovery protocols for training athletes. More research, less noise. See you Monday.</p>",
