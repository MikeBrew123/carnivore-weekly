  "content_html": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>You're eating carnivore. You're feeling great. Your skin's cleared up, you've got energy, and you're finally ready to get back out there and date.</p>\n<p>And then you remember: <strong>most people think eating only meat is completely unhinged.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"tldr-box\">\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don't lead with the diet</strong>—let them meet the healthy, confident version of you first</li>\n<li><strong>Pick stealth restaurants</strong>—steakhouse, Brazilian BBQ, seafood spots where your order blends in</li>\n<li><strong>Keep explanations simple</strong>—\"I'm experimenting with what makes me feel best\" not \"plants are poison\"</li>\n<li><strong>Watch their reaction</strong>—how they respond to your food choices reveals a lot about compatibility</li>\n<li><strong>Respect is the real filter</strong>—if they can't handle different choices, that's useful information</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>So how do you date when you're carnivore and they're...not? Here's what actually works.</p>\n<!-- First Date Strategy -->\n<div class=\"strategy-section\">\n<h2>The First Date: Stealth Mode Activated</h2>\n<p><strong>Real talk:</strong> Don't lead with the diet. Not on your profile, not in the first conversation, not at dinner.</p>\n<p>Why? Because \"I only eat meat\" sounds extreme to people who don't know the context. They haven't read the research. They haven't experienced what it's like to eliminate foods that cause inflammation. All they hear is \"this person has weird food rules\"—and that triggers alarm bells.</p>\n<div class=\"insight-box\">\n<p><strong>The move:</strong> Let them meet you first. The healthy, confident, interesting version of you. Then, if it comes up later, they've already decided they like you.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n                        \"Let them meet you first. The healthy, confident, interesting version of you. Then, if it comes up later, they've already decided they like you.\"\n                    </blockquote>\n<!-- Restaurant Strategy -->\n<div class=\"strategy-section\">\n<h2>Restaurant Selection: The Steakhouse Strategy</h2>\n<p>Pick restaurants where ordering a big steak is totally normal. The goal is to <strong>blend in</strong>—your food choices should look reasonable, not radical.</p>\n<div class=\"venue-grid\">\n<div class=\"venue-card good\">\n<h4>✓ Best First Date Spots</h4>\n<ul class=\"venue-list\">\n<li>\n<strong>🥩 Steakhouse</strong>\n<span class=\"venue-note\">You order ribeye, they order salmon. Nobody blinks.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🇧🇷 Brazilian BBQ</strong>\n<span class=\"venue-note\">All-you-can-eat meat parade. You're just \"enthusiastic.\"</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🦞 Seafood Restaurant</strong>\n<span class=\"venue-note\">Grilled fish, shrimp, lobster. Looks totally normal.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🍔 Upscale Burger Place</strong>\n<span class=\"venue-note\">Lettuce wrap or bunless. They'll think you're watching carbs.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"venue-card avoid\">\n<h4>✗ Avoid on First Dates</h4>\n<ul class=\"venue-list\">\n<li>\n<strong>🥗 Vegan Restaurants</strong>\n<span class=\"venue-note\">Obviously.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🍝 Pasta-Heavy Italian</strong>\n<span class=\"venue-note\">Limited carnivore options.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🍣 Sushi Places</strong>\n<span class=\"venue-note\">Unless you're okay with sashimi only.</span>\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>🌿 Prix Fixe Menus</strong>\n<span class=\"venue-note\">No control over courses.</span>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- Inline Image -->\n<figure class=\"inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Quality ribeye steak\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1000px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"../images/hero-steak-800w.webp\" srcset=\"../images/hero-steak-400w.webp 400w,\n                                     ../images/hero-steak-800w.webp 800w,\n                                     ../images/hero-steak-1200w.webp 1200w\"/>\n<figcaption>At a steakhouse, your order is just... normal</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<!-- The Simple Answer -->\n<div class=\"strategy-section\">\n<h2>If They Ask: The Simple Answer</h2>\n<p>Sometimes they notice. You're not eating the bread. You ordered your burger without the bun. You skipped the fries.</p>\n<p><em>\"Are you doing keto or something?\"</em></p>\n<div class=\"script-box\">\n<div class=\"script-label\">Your line:</div>\n<div class=\"script-text\">\"I'm experimenting with cutting out foods that were causing inflammation. Turns out I feel way better on mostly meat and fat. Still figuring it out, but it's working so far.\"</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"why-works\">\n<h4>Why this works:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It's personal</strong>—about you, not a crusade</li>\n<li><strong>It's experimental</strong>—you're not dogmatic</li>\n<li><strong>It's results-focused</strong>—\"feeling better\" is hard to argue with</li>\n<li><strong>It's vague enough</strong>—doesn't sound extreme</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dont-say\">\n<h4>What NOT to say on a first date:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\"Plants are toxic\" (even if you believe it)</li>\n<li>\"I only eat meat\" (sounds cult-y)</li>\n<li>\"Vegetables cause disease\" (conspiracy theorist vibes)</li>\n<li>Anything about seed oils, lectins, or oxalates (save it for date five)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>You're not lying. You're just not launching into a nutritional lecture while they're trying to enjoy their pasta.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- Red Flags Section -->\n<div class=\"strategy-section\">\n<h2>The Red Flags to Watch For</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, even when you're being chill about it, they react badly. <strong>That's useful information.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"flag-grid\">\n<div class=\"flag-card green\">\n<ul class=\"flag-examples\">\n<li>\"Oh, that's interesting. How's it going for you?\"</li>\n<li>\"I've heard about that. Is it hard to stick to?\"</li>\n<li>\"Whatever works for you. I just need my pizza.\"</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flag-card yellow\">\n<ul class=\"flag-examples\">\n<li>\"Isn't that unhealthy?\" (concerned but open)</li>\n<li>\"I could never do that.\" (fine if not judgmental)</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flag-card red\">\n<ul class=\"flag-examples\">\n<li>\"That's insane. You're going to have a heart attack.\"</li>\n<li>\"You need to eat vegetables. This is dangerous.\"</li>\n<li>Lecturing you about fiber, cholesterol, or the food pyramid</li>\n<li>Telling you you're wrong about your own body</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"insight-box\">\n<p><strong>The insight:</strong> If someone can't respect that you're doing something different with your diet, that's a compatibility issue. Not because of the food, but because they don't respect your autonomy.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- Timeline Section -->\n<div class=\"timeline-section\">\n<h2>When It Gets Serious: The Conversation</h2>\n<p>If you're dating someone for a few weeks and it's going well, eventually you'll need to actually talk about it.</p>\n<div class=\"timeline-item\">\n<span class=\"timeline-marker\">Week 2-3</span>\n<div class=\"timeline-content\">\n<h4>The Natural Mention</h4>\n<p>They've noticed your eating patterns. Time for a casual acknowledgment without making it a big deal.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"timeline-item\">\n<span class=\"timeline-marker\">Week 4-6</span>\n<div class=\"timeline-content\">\n<h4>The Real Conversation</h4>\n<p>If things are progressing, have an actual conversation about it. Be open to their questions.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"script-box\">\n<div class=\"script-label\">How to bring it up:</div>\n<div class=\"script-text\">\"Hey, I wanted to mention something. I've been eating this way for [X months], and it's made a huge difference in how I feel. I know it probably seems weird from the outside, but it's working for me. I'm not trying to convince you to do it—I just wanted you to understand why I eat the way I do.\"</div>\n</div>\n<p>Then let them ask questions. Most people are curious, not hostile, once they see that you're healthy and reasonable.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- Living Together -->\n<div class=\"cohabitation-box\">\n<h2>Living Together: The Long Game</h2>\n<p>If it gets really serious, you'll eventually deal with shared meals, grocery shopping, and cooking.</p>\n<div class=\"cohabitation-list\">\n<div class=\"cohabitation-item\">\n<span class=\"cohabitation-icon\">✓</span>\n<span>You cook meat. They add their carbs/veggies as sides.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cohabitation-item\">\n<span class=\"cohabitation-icon\">✓</span>\n<span>Separate meal prep works—you do your thing, they do theirs.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cohabitation-item\">\n<span class=\"cohabitation-icon\">✓</span>\n<span>Pick restaurants where both of you have good options.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cohabitation-item\">\n<span class=\"cohabitation-icon\">✓</span>\n<span>Respect each other's choices without constant commentary.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"insight-box\">\n<p><strong>Real talk:</strong> I know couples where one person eats carnivore and the other eats vegan. It works because they respect boundaries and don't make food a battleground.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- Bottom Line -->\n<div class=\"bottom-line\">\n<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>\n<p>Dating while carnivore doesn't have to be complicated. You're not hiding who you are. You're just not making your diet the first thing people learn about you.</p>\n<p>Pick restaurants where your food choices blend in. Keep your explanations simple and non-preachy. And if someone can't handle that you eat differently than they do, that's useful information about compatibility.</p>\n<p><strong>You're looking for someone who respects your choices, even if they don't make the same ones.</strong> And honestly? That's a good filter for a healthy relationship anyway.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Don't lead with the diet</strong>—let them get to know you first, then explain when it naturally comes up</li>\n<li><strong>Steakhouse strategy works</strong>—pick restaurants where ordering meat is completely normal</li>\n<li><strong>Keep the explanation simple</strong>—\"experimenting with what makes me feel best\" is perfect</li>\n<li><strong>Watch their reaction</strong>—how they respond to your different choices reveals compatibility</li>\n<li><strong>Respect goes both ways</strong>—you don't need to convert them, they don't need to approve of you</li>\n<li><strong>Long-term works</strong>—couples with different diets succeed when they respect boundaries</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>—Chloe</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 0.9em; color: #d4a574; margin-top: 30px; padding-top: 20px; border-top: 1px solid #8b4513;\">\n<em>Not relationship advice—just practical observations from someone who's deep in the community and has seen what works.
