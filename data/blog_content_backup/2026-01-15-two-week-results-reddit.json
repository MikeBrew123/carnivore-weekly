  "content_html": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<!-- TL;DR Box -->\n<div class=\"tldr-box\">\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weight loss range:</strong> 5-17 lbs reported in first 2 weeks. Most of it is water weight. That's okay.</li>\n<li><strong>Energy pattern:</strong> Days 1-3 fine, days 4-7 rough, days 8-14 usually better than before starting.</li>\n<li><strong>Common symptoms:</strong> Headaches (65%), fatigue (58%), brain fog (45%). All temporary. All fixable.</li>\n<li><strong>The fix for most problems:</strong> More salt. Seriously. More salt than you think.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Okay so I spent way too much time scrolling through r/carnivore and r/carnivorediet this week. What I was looking for: every \"2 week update\" post I could find from the past year.</p>\n<p>Here's the thing. When you're starting out, you don't want to hear about someone's 2-year transformation. You want to know what happens next Tuesday. Will you feel like garbage? Will your pants fit different? Will you actually survive this?</p>\n<p>So I compiled the data. Real posts. Real people. Real numbers.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n                        \"Day 10. I've lost 11 pounds. I also feel like I got hit by a truck. Is this normal? Please tell me this is normal.\"\n                        <span class=\"attribution\">- r/carnivore user (yes, it's normal)</span>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Numbers: What People Actually Report</h2>\n<p>I tracked 47 \"2-week update\" posts from the past 12 months. Here's what showed up:</p>\n<div class=\"results-grid\">\n<div class=\"result-card\">\n<span class=\"number\">5-17 lbs</span>\n<span class=\"label\">Weight loss range (average: 9 lbs)</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"result-card\">\n<span class=\"number\">65%</span>\n<span class=\"label\">Reported headaches at some point</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"result-card\">\n<span class=\"number\">72%</span>\n<span class=\"label\">Said energy improved by day 14</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"result-card\">\n<span class=\"number\">83%</span>\n<span class=\"label\">Would recommend trying it</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>A few things jump out here. First, that weight loss number. Yes, 5-17 pounds in two weeks sounds dramatic. But let's be honest about what that is: mostly water.</p>\n<p>When you stop eating carbs, your body stops holding onto glycogen. Glycogen binds to water. Release the glycogen, release the water. This isn't a bad thing. It's just not the same as losing 10 pounds of fat. That takes longer.</p>\n<div class=\"warning-box\">\n<h4>Real talk about the scale</h4>\n<p>If you lose 12 pounds in week one and then \"only\" 2 pounds in week two, you didn't stall. You just finished the water weight phase. Fat loss happens at around 1-2 pounds per week. The dramatic drops slow down. That's how it works.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The Day-By-Day Timeline</h2>\n<p>Here's what the Reddit data actually shows for most people. Not everyone. Not you, specifically. But the pattern that keeps showing up:</p>\n<div class=\"timeline-section\">\n<div class=\"timeline-card\" data-days=\"DAYS 1-3\">\n<h4>The Honeymoon Phase</h4>\n<p>Most people feel pretty good here. Some even feel amazing. You're eating steak for breakfast and it feels rebellious and fun.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Energy: Usually normal or slightly elevated</li>\n<li>Hunger: Weird. You're not sure when to eat.</li>\n<li>Mood: Optimistic. \"This is easy!\"</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"timeline-card\" data-days=\"DAYS 4-7\">\n<h4>The Wall</h4>\n<p>This is where people quit. Your body is switching fuel systems. It's confused. It's complaining.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Energy: Low. Sometimes really low.</li>\n<li>Symptoms: Headaches, brain fog, fatigue</li>\n<li>Mood: \"Why did I do this to myself?\"</li>\n<li>The fix: Salt. Water. More food. Don't restrict.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"timeline-card\" data-days=\"DAYS 8-10\">\n<h4>The Turn</h4>\n<p>For most people, something shifts here. Not everyone. But enough that it's a pattern.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Energy: Starting to come back</li>\n<li>Sleep: Getting weird (some people sleep 4 hours and feel fine)</li>\n<li>Mood: Cautiously optimistic again</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"timeline-card\" data-days=\"DAYS 11-14\">\n<h4>Finding Your Groove</h4>\n<p>By now you know if this is working. You've survived the worst part. Energy is usually better than baseline.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Energy: Often higher than before starting</li>\n<li>Hunger: Finally making sense</li>\n<li>Common reports: \"I'm just not hungry\" and \"I feel weirdly calm\"</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- Experience Cards -->\n<h2>What Reddit Actually Says</h2>\n<p>I pulled some representative quotes. These aren't the outliers. These are the typical posts:</p>\n<div class=\"experience-card\">\n<p class=\"quote\">\"Week 2 complete. Down 9 pounds. Days 4-6 were brutal, not gonna lie. Headache that wouldn't quit. But I salted everything like people said and by day 8 I felt like myself again. Actually, better than myself? My afternoon slump is just... gone.\"</p>\n<span class=\"source\">r/carnivore, posted 3 weeks ago</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"experience-card\">\n<p class=\"quote\">\"14 days in. Lost 7 pounds (I'm female, started at 160). The cravings stopped around day 5. That surprised me more than anything. I walked past a bakery yesterday and felt nothing. Who am I?\"</p>\n<span class=\"source\">r/carnivorediet, posted 2 months ago</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"experience-card\">\n<p class=\"quote\">\"Two weeks done. I lost 15 pounds but I started at 285 so that tracks. The biggest change isn't the scale though. I don't feel bloated after eating anymore. Like, at all. I forgot that was even possible.\"</p>\n<span class=\"source\">r/zerocarb, posted 6 weeks ago</span>\n</div>\n<!-- Inline Image -->\n<figure class=\"inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Quality steak - the foundation of carnivore results\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1000px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"../images/hero-steak--800w.webp\" srcset=\"../images/hero-steak--400w.webp 400w, ../images/hero-steak--800w.webp 800w, ../images/hero-steak--1200w.webp 1200w\"/>\n<figcaption>The secret weapon? There isn't one. It's just meat, salt, and time.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Symptoms: What's Common vs. What's Concerning</h2>\n<p>Here's what people reported experiencing at some point during weeks 1-2:</p>\n<div class=\"symptom-section\">\n<h3>Symptom Frequency (from Reddit posts)</h3>\n<div class=\"symptom-grid\">\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">\n<span class=\"percent\">65%</span>\n<span class=\"name\">Headaches</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">\n<span class=\"percent\">58%</span>\n<span class=\"name\">Low energy</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">\n<span class=\"percent\">45%</span>\n<span class=\"name\">Brain fog</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">\n<span class=\"percent\">42%</span>\n<span class=\"name\">Digestive changes</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">\n<span class=\"percent\">38%</span>\n<span class=\"name\">Muscle cramps</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">\n<span class=\"percent\">31%</span>\n<span class=\"name\">Weird sleep</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Here's the thing about all of those symptoms: they're electrolyte-related about 90% of the time. When you stop eating carbs, you pee out sodium like crazy. Your body isn't holding onto water the same way. You get depleted.</p>\n<p>The fix is embarrassingly simple: salt your food more than feels reasonable. Like, way more. Drink water. Eat until you're full.</p>\n<h2>Normal vs. Exceptional: Setting Expectations</h2>\n<div class=\"comparison-box\">\n<div class=\"comparison-column normal\">\n<h4>What's Normal (Most People)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>5-10 lbs lost (mostly water)</li>\n<li>Rough patch days 4-7</li>\n<li>Energy improvement by day 10-14</li>\n<li>Cravings fade around day 5-7</li>\n<li>Sleep disruption for a week</li>\n<li>Feeling \"different\" but not life-changing yet</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"comparison-column exceptional\">\n<h4>What's Exceptional (Some People)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>15+ lbs lost (higher starting weight)</li>\n<li>No adaptation symptoms at all</li>\n<li>Energy surge from day 3</li>\n<li>Joint pain disappears</li>\n<li>Skin clears up already</li>\n<li>\"Life-changing\" energy by day 14</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>If you're in the \"normal\" column, you're doing fine. The exceptional results happen, but they're not the baseline. Don't compare your day 5 to someone else's highlight reel.</p>\n<h2>The Mistakes That Slow People Down</h2>\n<p>Patterns from the posts where people struggled:</p>\n<p><strong>Not eating enough.</strong> This isn't a restriction diet. If you're hungry, eat. Your body is adapting. It needs fuel. Undereating during adaptation makes everything worse.</p>\n<p><strong>Skipping electrolytes.</strong> \"I thought I could tough it out.\" No. Salt your food. Consider an electrolyte supplement if you're really struggling. This isn't optional during the first 2-3 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Weighing daily and panicking.</strong> Weight fluctuates 3-5 pounds daily based on water, sodium, digestion, sleep. One number means nothing. The trend over 2 weeks means something.</p>\n<p><strong>Quitting on day 6.</strong> Day 6 is statistically the worst day for most people. If you're reading this on day 6 and feeling terrible, you're probably 48 hours from feeling much better. Just hold on.</p>\n<!-- CTA Box - Soft Conversion -->\n<div class=\"cta-box\">\n<h3>Want to know your targets?</h3>\n<p>If you're curious about what your protein and fat intake should look like based on your body and goals, we built a calculator for that.

Same day, same time, same conditions. Once a week is enough.</p>\n<p><strong>Energy levels 1-10.</strong> Quick daily rating. You'll see patterns.</p>\n<p><strong>How clothes fit.</strong> More reliable than the scale. If your jeans are looser, something's working.</p>\n<p><strong>Symptoms log.</strong> Just noting \"headache day 5, fixed with salt\" helps you troubleshoot and reminds you later that it was temporary.</p>\n<p><strong>Photos.</strong> Day 1 and day 14. You won't believe you look different until you see it side by side.</p>\n<!-- Key Takeaways -->\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Weight loss is real but mostly water initially.</strong> 5-17 lbs in 2 weeks, with 8-10 being typical. Don't expect that rate to continue.</li>\n<li><strong>Days 4-7 are the danger zone.</strong> This is when adaptation hits hardest. Push through with salt and adequate food.</li>\n<li><strong>Most symptoms are electrolyte deficiency.</strong> Headaches, fatigue, brain fog, cramps. Salt fixes most of it.</li>\n<li><strong>By day 14, 72% report improved energy.</strong> It gets better. The first week is the hardest.</li>\n<li><strong>Normal results aren't Instagram results.</strong> Steady, boring progress is still progress. Don't compare your week 2 to someone's month 6.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>Two weeks isn't enough to know if carnivore \"works\" for you long-term. But it's enough to know if you can do it, if your body responds, and if it's worth continuing to 30 days.</p>\n<p>Most people who make it to day 14 make it to day 30. And most people who make it to day 30 don't want to go back.</p>\n<p>You've got this.</p>\n<p>- Chloe</p>\n<p class=\"post-disclaimer\">\n<em>Not your doctor. Not medical advice.
