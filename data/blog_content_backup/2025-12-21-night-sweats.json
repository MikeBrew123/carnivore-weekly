You're doing great during the day, sleeping fine, then you wake up drenched. It's uncomfortable. It's also fixable. Let me walk you through why it happens and what actually helps.</p>\n<h2>Why Night Sweats Happen on Carnivore</h2>\n<p>There are a few reasons this shows up, and they're not all the same for everyone.</p>\n<div class=\"cause-cards\">\n<div class=\"cause-card\">\n<h4>Metabolism Ramping Up</h4>\n<p>When you switch to carnivore, your metabolism often increases. Your body is working harder, burning more calories, generating more heat. Night sweats are sometimes just that: your body producing more heat than it's used to. Usually settles down after a few weeks.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cause-card\">\n<h4>Electrolyte Imbalance</h4>\n<p>The most likely culprit. Sweat is how your body releases excess electrolytes it can't use. If you're not getting enough sodium, potassium, or magnesium, your body uses sweat to balance—especially at night when you're lying down and fluid redistributes.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cause-card\">\n<h4>Hormonal Adjustment</h4>\n<p>Carnivore can affect hormones, especially during weight loss. Your body releases stored estrogen from fat tissue. This can trigger hot flashes and night sweats, especially for women. It's temporary and means your body is working.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cause-card\">\n<h4>Temperature Sensitivity</h4>\n<p>Some people just run hotter on carnivore. Higher metabolic rate. The thermostat in your brain shifts. It's not dangerous—it's just different. A cooler bedroom and lighter blanket help.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\nThis is fixable in days. More salt. That's often the whole solution.\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What Actually Works</h2>\n<div class=\"fix-step\">\n<span class=\"fix-step-number\">1</span>\n<h4>Start With Salt</h4>\n<p>Get 1-2 teaspoons of salt per day. Add it to your food, dissolve it in water, doesn't matter. Most people see night sweats improve significantly within 3 days. This is the single most effective fix.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fix-step\">\n<span class=\"fix-step-number\">2</span>\n<h4>Add Magnesium</h4>\n<p>If salt helps but doesn't eliminate the sweats, look at magnesium. 300-400mg magnesium glycinate before bed helps many people. It also improves sleep quality overall.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fix-step\">\n<span class=\"fix-step-number\">3</span>\n<h4>Consider Potassium</h4>\n<p>Potassium is trickier (high potassium can be risky), but adding bone broth (high in minerals) often helps. You can also eat more red meat, which is naturally higher in potassium than chicken.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"fix-step\">\n<span class=\"fix-step-number\">4</span>\n<h4>Fix Your Sleep Environment</h4>\n<p>Drop the room temperature to 65-67°F if you can. Get breathable sheets (cotton or linen, not synthetic). Wear less. A heavier blanket doesn't help; a lighter one does.</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"post-inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Bone broth for electrolytes and minerals\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"/images/bone-broth-800w.webp\" srcset=\"/images/bone-broth-400w.webp 400w, /images/bone-broth-800w.webp 800w, /images/bone-broth-1200w.webp 1200w\">\n<figcaption>Bone broth: a natural source of sodium, potassium, and other minerals</figcaption>\n</img></figure>\n<h2>Timing Matters</h2>\n<p>When your night sweats happen can tell you a lot about the cause.</p>\n<div class=\"timing-guide\">\n<h4>When Do You Wake Up Sweating?</h4>\n<div class=\"timing-row\">\n<span class=\"timing-when\">First 2-3 hours</span>\n<span class=\"timing-cause\">Usually metabolic heat from digestion. Try eating earlier in the evening.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"timing-row\">\n<span class=\"timing-when\">4+ hours in</span>\n<span class=\"timing-cause\">More likely electrolytes or hormonal. Focus on salt and minerals.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"timing-row\">\n<span class=\"timing-when\">Throughout the night</span>\n<span class=\"timing-cause\">Likely a combination. Address electrolytes AND sleep environment.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>When to Actually Worry</h2>\n<div class=\"warning-box\">\n<h4>See a Doctor If...</h4>\n<p>Drenching, every-night sweats for weeks straight despite trying the fixes above might warrant a doctor visit to rule out infection or thyroid issues. But most of the time, night sweats on carnivore are normal adaptation and you fix them with salt and a cooler room.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>What Most People Miss</h2>\n<p>They add layers and close windows instead of making the room cooler. They assume they need expensive electrolyte supplements instead of just more salt. They don't give it time—night sweats usually improve by week 2 or 3 of addressing the underlying cause.</p>\n<h2>The Honest Take</h2>\n<p>Night sweats are uncomfortable but they're a sign your body is adapting to a new fuel source and working harder. Address electrolytes and temperature, give it 2-3 weeks, and most people see significant improvement. If you're still soaked every night after that, that's worth checking with a doctor.</p>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>More salt (1-2 tsp daily) fixes most carnivore night sweats within 2-3 days.</li>\n<li>Four main causes: electrolyte imbalance, increased metabolism, hormonal shifts from fat loss, and temperature sensitivity.</li>\n<li>Cool your bedroom (65-67°F), use lighter blankets, and consider magnesium before bed.</li>\n<li>Timing matters: early-night sweats = digestion; late-night = electrolytes/hormones.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>—Sarah</p>\n<p class=\"post-disclaimer\">\n<em>Not medical advice. Occasional night sweats during carnivore adaptation are normal. Persistent severe night sweats should be evaluated by a healthcare provider to rule out other causes.</em>\n</p>\n\n</div>",
