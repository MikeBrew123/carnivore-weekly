Then you book a flight.</p>\n<p>And suddenly you're staring at airport food courts wondering if you're about to eat Cinnabon for the first time in six months.</p>\n<div class=\"tldr-box\">\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pack TSA-approved foods</strong>—beef jerky, hard-boiled eggs, cheese sticks, pre-cooked bacon, canned fish</li>\n<li><strong>Skip the food court</strong>—airport sit-down restaurants have steaks, burgers, and eggs</li>\n<li><strong>Flight strategy</strong>—eat before boarding, fast during, or request special meals 48 hours ahead</li>\n<li><strong>International</strong>—meat is universal, but check customs rules before packing</li>\n<li><strong>Hotels</strong>—hit the grocery store on arrival for emergency backup meals</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Travel is where most people fall off carnivore.</strong> Not because they want to quit, but because they didn't plan ahead and got stuck with no options. Here's how the community actually handles it.</p>\n<!-- Packing List Section -->\n<div class=\"section-card\">\n<h2>The Packing List: TSA-Approved Carnivore Foods</h2>\n<p>TSA allows solid foods through security. Liquids are the problem. So your carry-on strategy is: <strong>pack dry, shelf-stable protein.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"packing-list\">\n<div class=\"packing-item\">\n<span class=\"packing-icon\">🥩</span>\n<div class=\"packing-content\">\n<h4>Beef Jerky</h4>\n<p>Lightweight, doesn't need refrigeration, high protein. Pack 3-4 bags for a long trip.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"packing-item\">\n<span class=\"packing-icon\">🥓</span>\n<div class=\"packing-content\">\n<h4>Pre-Cooked Bacon</h4>\n<p>Wrap in paper towels, pack in Ziplock. Smells like bacon on the plane (your seatmate will be jealous).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"packing-item\">\n<span class=\"packing-icon\">🥚</span>\n<div class=\"packing-content\">\n<h4>Hard-Boiled Eggs</h4>\n<p>Pre-peel at home, pack in a small container. Eat within 24 hours.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"packing-item\">\n<span class=\"packing-icon\">🧀</span>\n<div class=\"packing-content\">\n<h4>Cheese Sticks / Cubes</h4>\n<p>Can survive a few hours unrefrigerated. Pack in a small cooler bag with ice pack if paranoid.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"packing-item\">\n<span class=\"packing-icon\">🐟</span>\n<div class=\"packing-content\">\n<h4>Canned Fish</h4>\n<p>Sardines, mackerel, or salmon. Pack a fork. Don't care what people think.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"packing-item\">\n<span class=\"packing-icon\">🍖</span>\n<div class=\"packing-content\">\n<h4>Carnivore Bars</h4>\n<p>Carnivore Bar, EPIC bars, or Tanka bars. Convenient, expensive, but worth it for travel.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"packing-item\">\n<span class=\"packing-icon\">🐷</span>\n<div class=\"packing-content\">\n<h4>Pork Rinds</h4>\n<p>Crunchy, fatty, keeps forever. Good for snacking between meals.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"protip-box\">\n<strong>Pro tip: </strong>\n<span>Bring salt packets. A lot of travel food is under-salted and you'll feel it. Electrolyte packets (like LMNT) are also TSA-friendly and convenient for long flights.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n                        \"Travel is where most people fall off carnivore. Not because they want to quit, but because they didn't plan ahead and got stuck with no options.\"\n                    </blockquote>\n<!-- Airport Strategy Section -->\n<div class=\"section-card\">\n<h2>Airport Strategy: Where to Actually Eat</h2>\n<p>Most airports have at least one sit-down restaurant. <strong>That's where you go.</strong></p>\n<div class=\"restaurant-grid\">\n<div class=\"restaurant-card\">\n<div class=\"restaurant-type\">🥩 Steakhouse / Burger</div>\n<div class=\"restaurant-order\">Steak, burger (no bun), eggs, bacon. Easy win every time.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"restaurant-card\">\n<div class=\"restaurant-type\">🍳 Breakfast Spots</div>\n<div class=\"restaurant-order\">Eggs, bacon, sausage. Skip the toast and hash browns.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"restaurant-card\">\n<div class=\"restaurant-type\">🦐 Seafood</div>\n<div class=\"restaurant-order\">Grilled fish or shrimp. Most airports have at least one option.</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"restaurant-card\">\n<div class=\"restaurant-type\">🌮 Mexican</div>\n<div class=\"restaurant-order\">Carnitas or carne asada bowl. No rice, no beans, no tortilla.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Yes, it's overpriced. Yes, the steak won't be amazing. But it's better than breaking your protocol because you got desperate.</p>\n<div class=\"foodcourt-box\">\n<h4>Food Court Options (If You're Stuck)</h4>\n<div class=\"foodcourt-list\">\n<div class=\"foodcourt-item\">\n<span class=\"foodcourt-name\">Five Guys</span>\n<span>Burger, lettuce wrap, extra bacon</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"foodcourt-item\">\n<span class=\"foodcourt-name\">Chipotle</span>\n<span>Carnitas bowl, no rice/beans, extra meat</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"foodcourt-item\">\n<span class=\"foodcourt-name\">Shake Shack</span>\n<span>Burger, no bun, add egg</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"foodcourt-item\">\n<span class=\"foodcourt-name\">Any Grill</span>\n<span>Grilled chicken or beef, skip the rice</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Most chains will accommodate \"no bun\" requests. Don't be shy about it.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- Inline Image -->\n<figure class=\"inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Airport restaurant steak\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 1000px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"../images/hero-steak-800w.webp\" srcset=\"../images/hero-steak-400w.webp 400w,\n                                     ../images/hero-steak-800w.webp 800w,\n                                     ../images/hero-steak-1200w.webp 1200w\"/>\n<figcaption>Airport steakhouses exist—find them before you fly</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<!-- Flight Strategy Section -->\n<div class=\"section-card\">\n<h2>The Flight Itself: Your Three Options</h2>\n<p>Long flights are tricky. You're stuck in a metal tube for 10 hours and the meal service is pasta or pasta.</p>\n<div class=\"flight-options\">\n<div class=\"flight-option\">\n<div class=\"option-content\">\n<p>This is what a lot of carnivores do. Eat a big meal before you board. Don't eat on the plane. Eat when you land.</p>\n<p>If you're fat-adapted, fasting for 10-12 hours is easy. You're not going to starve. You'll actually feel better than if you ate the airplane food.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flight-option\">\n<div class=\"option-content\">\n<p>Most airlines let you request special meals 24-48 hours before your flight.</p>\n<div class=\"special-meals\">\n<h4>Look for these options:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>\"Low carb meal\"</strong> — usually chicken or fish with vegetables</li>\n<li><strong>\"Gluten-free meal\"</strong> — sometimes has meat and eggs</li>\n<li><strong>\"Diabetic meal\"</strong> — often higher protein, lower carb</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>It's not perfect, but it's better than the standard pasta tray.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"flight-option\">\n<div class=\"option-content\">\n<p>Pack the foods from the packing list above. Eat your beef jerky and hard-boiled eggs mid-flight. Ignore the meal service.</p>\n<p>Your seatmate might give you a weird look when you pull out pre-cooked bacon. You're fine.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- International Travel Section -->\n<div class=\"section-card\">\n<h2>International Travel: Region by Region</h2>\n<p>Flying internationally adds complications: longer flights, customs rules, different food cultures.</p>\n<div class=\"customs-warning\">\n<h4>Customs Rules for Food:</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Most countries don't allow you to bring meat products across borders. Check before you pack.</li>\n<li>Commercially packaged foods (jerky, bars) are usually fine. Fresh meat is not.</li>\n<li>When in doubt, finish your food before you land or toss it before customs.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Good news:</strong> Meat is universal. Every culture has steak, chicken, fish, or eggs.</p>\n<div class=\"region-grid\">\n<div class=\"region-card\">\n<p class=\"region-tips\">Steakhouses everywhere. Order meat, skip the bread and potatoes. French bistros, German bratwurst, Italian secondi—meat is celebrated.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"region-card\">\n<p class=\"region-tips\">Carnivore paradise. Argentinian asado, Brazilian churrasco. You're literally living your best life here.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"region-card\">\n<p class=\"region-tips\">Harder but doable. Grilled meats, hot pot (meat only), Korean BBQ, Japanese yakiniku. Avoid sauces with sugar—they're everywhere.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"region-card\">\n<p class=\"region-tips\">Kebabs, grilled chicken, lamb dishes. Easy carnivore wins. Skip the pita and hummus.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The trick is finding sit-down restaurants instead of relying on street food or convenience stores.</p>\n</div>\n<!-- Hotel Hacks Section -->\n<div class=\"section-card\">\n<h2>Hotel Hacks: Staying Carnivore on the Road</h2>\n<p>Once you're at your destination, you need a strategy for meals.</p>\n<div class=\"hotel-grid\">\n<div class=\"hotel-hack\">\n<span class=\"hotel-icon\">🍳</span>\n<div class=\"hotel-content\">\n<h4>Hotel Breakfast Buffet</h4>\n<p>Most hotels have eggs, bacon, sausage. Load up on protein in the morning and you can skip lunch if needed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hotel-hack\">\n<span class=\"hotel-icon\">🛒</span>\n<div class=\"hotel-content\">\n<h4>Grocery Store Run</h4>\n<p>Hit a local grocery store when you arrive. Stock up on emergency backup meals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Pre-cooked rotisserie chicken</li>\n<li>Deli meat and cheese</li>\n<li>Hard-boiled eggs</li>\n<li>Canned fish</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hotel-hack\">\n<span class=\"hotel-icon\">📱</span>\n<div class=\"hotel-content\">\n<h4>Room Service / Delivery Apps</h4>\n<p>Most hotels and apps like Uber Eats have steak, burgers, or grilled chicken. Order bunless, skip the sides, add extra protein.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- Mindset Section -->\n<div class=\"mindset-box\">\n<h3>The Mindset Shift</h3>\n<p>Here's the thing about traveling carnivore: It's not as hard as you think once you accept that <strong>your meals won't be perfect.</strong></p>\n<p>You're not going to get grassfed ribeye at the airport. That's okay. You're getting protein and fat, staying in ketosis, and avoiding the foods that make you feel like garbage.</p>\n<p>Travel is temporary. One suboptimal steak at an airport restaurant won't ruin your progress. But caving and eating pizza because you didn't plan ahead will make you feel worse.</p>\n<p><strong>Plan ahead. Pack snacks. Know where the airport restaurants are.</strong> And if worst comes to worst, fasting for a few hours won't kill you.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pack TSA-approved foods</strong>—beef jerky, pre-cooked bacon, hard-boiled eggs, cheese, canned fish, carnivore bars</li>\n<li><strong>Airport sit-down restaurants</strong> are your friend—find the steakhouse or breakfast spot before you fly</li>\n<li><strong>Food court chains work</strong>—Five Guys, Chipotle, Shake Shack all accommodate no-bun requests</li>\n<li><strong>Flights: fast, special meal, or BYO</strong>—pick your strategy based on flight length</li>\n<li><strong>International: check customs rules</strong>—finish packaged foods before landing, fresh meat usually isn't allowed</li>\n<li><strong>Hotels: grocery store on arrival</strong>—stock up on emergency protein for your room fridge</li>\n<li><strong>Accept imperfection</strong>—suboptimal steak beats breaking protocol</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>—Chloe</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 0.9em; color: #d4a574; margin-top: 30px; padding-top: 20px; border-top: 1px solid #8b4513;\">\n<em>These are community strategies, not medical or customs advice.
