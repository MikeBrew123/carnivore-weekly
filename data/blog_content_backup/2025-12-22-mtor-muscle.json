This matters more than timing or supplements.</li>\n<li>Training stimulus still matters most. mTOR activation means nothing without progressive overload.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>mTOR gets a lot of hype. People talk about \"activating mTOR\" and \"suppressing mTOR\" like it's the master control switch for everything. It's not. But it is important for muscle building, and carnivore interacts with it in interesting ways.</p>\n<p>Let me be direct: mTOR is a protein that helps your body build muscle. More mTOR activation, more muscle growth potential. Less mTOR, less muscle building. On carnivore, you have leverage to control mTOR pretty effectively.</p>\n<h2>How mTOR Actually Works</h2>\n<div class=\"mechanism-box\">\n<h4>What Activates mTOR</h4>\n<div class=\"mechanism-item\">\n<span class=\"mechanism-trigger\">Protein</span>\n<span class=\"mechanism-effect\">Primary activator. Eating protein directly triggers mTOR signaling.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mechanism-item\">\n<span class=\"mechanism-trigger\">Leucine</span>\n<span class=\"mechanism-effect\">Amino acid that specifically triggers mTOR. Meat is loaded with it.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mechanism-item\">\n<span class=\"mechanism-trigger\">Insulin</span>\n<span class=\"mechanism-effect\">Carbs spike insulin, which activates mTOR. But you don't need this pathway.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mechanism-item\">\n<span class=\"mechanism-trigger\">Training</span>\n<span class=\"mechanism-effect\">Mechanical tension from lifting triggers local mTOR activation in muscle.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\nCarnivore gives you natural mTOR activation through protein without needing the carb spike. Eat meat, lift heavy, sleep enough, repeat.\n</blockquote>\n<p>High protein activates mTOR. Low carbs don't suppress it as much as you'd think because you're eating meat, which is protein-rich. The result: mTOR stays active enough for muscle building, without the insulin spike that normally comes with carbs.</p>\n<h3>Why This Matters</h3>\n<p>Traditional bodybuilding wisdom says you need carbs to build muscle because carbs spike insulin, which activates mTOR. On carnivore, you get mTOR activation from protein alone. You build muscle without needing the carb-insulin mechanism. This is one of the biggest advantages carnivore has for strength athletes.</p>\n<h2>The Real Priorities for Muscle Building</h2>\n<div class=\"priority-grid\">\n<div class=\"priority-card\">\n<span class=\"priority-number\">1</span>\n<h4>Training Stimulus</h4>\n<p>mTOR activation means nothing without the stimulus. Progressive overload, compound movements, sufficient volume. If you're not training hard, mTOR can't do anything.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"priority-card\">\n<span class=\"priority-number\">2</span>\n<h4>Protein Intake</h4>\n<p>Hit 1.0-1.2g per pound of target body weight. Beef, fish, eggs, organs. This matters more than any supplement or timing protocol.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"priority-card\">\n<span class=\"priority-number\">3</span>\n<h4>Total Calories</h4>\n<p>You can't build muscle in a significant deficit. Eat enough fat alongside your protein to support growth.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"priority-card\">\n<span class=\"priority-number\">4</span>\n<h4>Sleep &amp; Recovery</h4>\n<p>Muscle is built during recovery, not in the gym. 7-9 hours of quality sleep. Manage stress.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"protein-target\">\n<h4>Your Protein Target</h4>\n<div class=\"target-number\">1.0-1.2g per lb</div>\n<p>of target body weight, daily</p>\n</div>\n<figure class=\"post-inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Cooking steak for post-workout protein\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"/images/lifestyle-cooking-800w.webp\" srcset=\"/images/lifestyle-cooking-400w.webp 400w, /images/lifestyle-cooking-800w.webp 800w, /images/lifestyle-cooking-1200w.webp 1200w\">\n<figcaption>Simple approach: quality meat, adequate volume, consistent training</figcaption>\n</img></figure>\n<h2>How to Actually Leverage This</h2>\n<p>Eat protein. Specifically, eat enough that you're hitting 1.0-1.2g per pound of target body weight. This matters more than anything else.</p>\n<p><strong>Best carnivore foods for mTOR activation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Beef</strong> — protein plus natural creatine</li>\n<li><strong>Fish</strong> — high leucine content, omega-3s</li>\n<li><strong>Eggs</strong> — complete amino acid profile</li>\n<li><strong>Organ meats</strong> — nutrients that support muscle building</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fat doesn't directly activate mTOR, but you need fat for hormone production (testosterone, growth hormone), which supports muscle building indirectly. Eat plenty of it.</p>\n<h2>The Timing Question</h2>\n<p>Should you eat right after training to spike mTOR? On carnivore, eating raises protein and mTOR steadily because of the protein content. It's not a dramatic spike like carbs would cause.</p>\n<p><strong>The practical answer:</strong> Eating within 2-3 hours of training is probably fine. Having to eat right immediately isn't as critical on carnivore as traditional nutrition science suggests. Total daily protein matters more than timing.</p>\n<h2>What You Don't Need</h2>\n<div class=\"skip-box\">\n<h4>Skip These</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Leucine supplements</strong> — You're eating meat. Meat is loaded with leucine.</li>\n<li><strong>Special timing protocols</strong> — Eat when it works for you. Total protein matters more.</li>\n<li><strong>mTOR cycling</strong> — The \"activate, suppress, repeat\" approach is overthinking it.</li>\n<li><strong>Carbs post-workout</strong> — Protein alone activates mTOR effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<h2>One Thing People Get Wrong</h2>\n<p>They think mTOR activation is all that matters for muscle. It's one piece. You also need: enough total calories, enough sleep, adequate training stimulus, consistency. mTOR is just the mechanism your body uses to build muscle, not the whole game.</p>\n<h2>The Performance-Focused Take</h2>\n<p>Carnivore gives you natural mTOR activation through protein without needing the carb spike. If you're training hard and eating enough protein, you're set up well for muscle building. Don't overthink it. Eat meat, lift heavy, sleep enough, repeat.</p>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>mTOR is activated by protein—you don't need carbs or insulin spikes to build muscle on carnivore.</li>\n<li>Target 1.0-1.2g protein per pound of target body weight. This matters more than supplements or timing.</li>\n<li>Training stimulus is still #1. Progressive overload, compound movements, sufficient volume.</li>\n<li>Skip the leucine supplements and special timing protocols. Eat meat, train hard, sleep well.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>—Marcus</p>\n<p class=\"post-disclaimer\">\n<em>Not medical advice. This is educational content about muscle building science.
