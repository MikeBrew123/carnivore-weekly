It's not comfortable. And it's not for long-term use.</li>\n<li>On carnivore PSMF: eat 1g protein per pound target body weight, minimal fat. Think chicken breast, lean sirloin, white fish.</li>\n<li>Use it as a 4-8 week sprint for a specific goal, not as your main protocol.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>PSMF stands for Protein Sparing Modified Fast. It's basically eating protein only, minimal fat, to hit aggressive fat loss goals. A lot of carnivores are asking: can I do PSMF on carnivore? Is it safe? Does it actually work?</p>\n<p>Here's the real answer: It works. It's not comfortable. And probably not something you should do for long.</p>\n<h2>What Is PSMF Actually?</h2>\n<p>PSMF is eating roughly 1.0g of protein per pound of target body weight, with as little fat as possible. On carnivore, that means eating very lean meat only.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\nPSMF is the hammer for \"I need fat loss fast.\" But most of the time, regular carnivore with plenty of fat is the right tool.\n</blockquote>\n<p>The goal is to lose fat while theoretically preserving muscle. It's a shortcut. A fast shortcut. And like most shortcuts, it comes with trade-offs.</p>\n<h2>Does It Work? Yes, But...</h2>\n<p>Fat loss is straightforward: calories in vs. calories out. PSMF creates an extreme calorie deficit because you're eating protein (expensive calorically to digest) and almost no fat. You will lose fat, and you'll lose it quickly.</p>\n<p>Most people lose 2-4 pounds per week on PSMF. That's real. That's also the kind of weight loss that gets everyone's attention.</p>\n<div class=\"warning-box\">\n<h4>The Trade-Offs</h4>\n<p>You'll be hungry. You'll be cold. Your energy will dip. You might lose some muscle despite eating protein—the deficit is too extreme for many people to preserve 100% of muscle mass. This is a sprint tool, not a lifestyle.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>What PSMF Looks Like on Carnivore</h2>\n<div class=\"psmf-foods\">\n<div class=\"psmf-food-card psmf-food-card--yes\">\n<h4>Eat These (Lean Protein)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Chicken breast (skinless)</li>\n<li>White fish (cod, tilapia, halibut)</li>\n<li>Extra lean ground beef (96/4)</li>\n<li>Sirloin steak (trimmed)</li>\n<li>Turkey breast</li>\n<li>Egg whites (limit whole eggs)</li>\n<li>Shrimp and shellfish</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"psmf-food-card psmf-food-card--no\">\n<h4>Avoid These (High Fat)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Ribeye and fatty steaks</li>\n<li>Bacon</li>\n<li>Butter and tallow</li>\n<li>Egg yolks (or limit heavily)</li>\n<li>Chicken thighs (skin on)</li>\n<li>Ground beef 80/20</li>\n<li>Pork belly</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This is the opposite of what feels good on carnivore. No butter. No fatty cuts. You'll notice the difference immediately.</p>\n<h2>How Long Should You Do PSMF?</h2>\n<div class=\"psmf-timeline\">\n<h4>Recommended Timeline</h4>\n<div class=\"timeline-item\">\n<span class=\"timeline-week\">Week 1-2</span>\n<span class=\"timeline-desc\">Adaptation phase. Hunger is highest. Energy drops. Push through.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"timeline-item\">\n<span class=\"timeline-week\">Week 3-4</span>\n<span class=\"timeline-desc\">Body adapts somewhat. Results accelerate. Still uncomfortable.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"timeline-item\">\n<span class=\"timeline-week\">Week 5-8</span>\n<span class=\"timeline-desc\">Max recommended duration. Hit your goal, then exit.</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"timeline-item\">\n<span class=\"timeline-week\">After 8 weeks</span>\n<span class=\"timeline-desc\">Transition back to regular carnivore. Slowly add fat back in.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Should You Do It?</h2>\n<p>Not for months. Maybe 4-8 weeks if you need to hit a specific goal. A wedding, a photo shoot, something with a deadline. Not as a lifestyle.</p>\n<p>If you're healthy, your body composition is already decent, and you just want to get leaner, PSMF works. If you're starting from overweight or you have metabolic issues, start with regular carnivore first. Get that working. Then consider PSMF as a finishing move, not the main strategy.</p>\n<h2>One Thing People Get Wrong</h2>\n<p>PSMF is a tool. Tools have specific uses. You don't use a hammer when you need a screwdriver. PSMF is the hammer for \"I need fat loss fast.\" But most of the time, regular carnivore (with plenty of fat) is the right tool.</p>\n<p>Use PSMF as a sprint. Not a marathon.</p>\n<figure class=\"post-inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Cooking lean meat in a pan\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"/images/lifestyle-cooking-800w.webp\" srcset=\"/images/lifestyle-cooking-400w.webp 400w, /images/lifestyle-cooking-800w.webp 800w, /images/lifestyle-cooking-1200w.webp 1200w\">\n<figcaption>Keep it simple: lean protein, hot pan, salt. That's PSMF on carnivore.</figcaption>\n</img></figure>\n<h2>The Honest Take</h2>\n<p>PSMF works. It sucks. It's temporary. If you understand those three things and you still want to do it, you'll be fine. Just don't expect it to feel amazing. The results will be amazing. The experience will be uncomfortable. That's the trade-off.</p>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>PSMF creates rapid fat loss (2-4 lbs/week) through extreme calorie deficit with high protein intake.</li>\n<li>On carnivore, PSMF means lean meats only: chicken breast, white fish, extra lean ground beef, trimmed sirloin.</li>\n<li>Use it for 4-8 weeks max as a sprint toward a specific goal—not as your regular eating pattern.</li>\n<li>If you're new to carnivore or have metabolic issues, get stable on regular carnivore first before considering PSMF.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>—Casey</p>\n<p class=\"post-disclaimer\">\n<em>Not medical advice. PSMF is an aggressive protocol that may not be appropriate for everyone. Consult a healthcare provider before starting any extreme dietary intervention, especially if you have underlying health conditions.</em>\n</p>\n\n</div>",
