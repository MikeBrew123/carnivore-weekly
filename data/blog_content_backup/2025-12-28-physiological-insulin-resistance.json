  "content_html": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>If you've ever had a glucose test or checked your insulin levels on carnivore, you might have seen something weird: your fasting glucose is fine, but your insulin is elevated. Or your glucose tolerance test shows a sluggish response to sugar.</p>\n<div class=\"tldr-box\">\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Physiological IR ≠ pathological IR</strong> — same name, totally different mechanisms</li>\n<li><strong>Your muscles spare glucose</strong> — they're running on fat, saving glucose for your brain</li>\n<li><strong>It's adaptive, not broken</strong> — this is your metabolism working correctly on low-carb</li>\n<li><strong>Check the right markers:</strong> inflammation, lipids, triglycerides matter more than IR label</li>\n<li><strong>It reverses in weeks</strong> if you add carbs back</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Your doctor might worry. You might worry. But this is actually normal. It's called physiological insulin resistance, and on carnivore, it's a sign your metabolism is working correctly.</p>\n<h2>What Is Physiological Insulin Resistance?</h2>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n                        \"Insulin resistance sounds bad. It sounds broken. It's not. Physiological insulin resistance is your body's adaptation to a low-carb environment.\"\n                    </blockquote>\n<p>When you're in a low-carb state consistently, your muscles become insulin resistant by design. They're not taking up glucose because you're not giving them much glucose. Your body shuttles what little glucose you produce to your brain (the only organ that strictly needs glucose) and stores it. Everywhere else is running on fat.</p>\n<div class=\"mechanism-box\">\n<h4>How It Works</h4>\n<div class=\"mechanism-steps\">\n<div class=\"mechanism-step\">\n<span class=\"num\">1</span>\n<span class=\"text\"><strong>Low carb intake</strong> — Your body receives minimal glucose from food</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mechanism-step\">\n<span class=\"num\">2</span>\n<span class=\"text\"><strong>Muscles adapt</strong> — They switch to fat as primary fuel, become \"resistant\" to insulin</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mechanism-step\">\n<span class=\"num\">3</span>\n<span class=\"text\"><strong>Glucose sparing</strong> — Available glucose is reserved for the brain</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mechanism-step\">\n<span class=\"num\">4</span>\n<span class=\"text\"><strong>Stable energy</strong> — Body runs efficiently on fat/ketones, not glucose</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>This is adaptive. It's correct. It means your metabolism has shifted to using fat as its primary fuel.</p>\n<h2>Why This Is Different From Pathological Insulin Resistance</h2>\n<div class=\"comparison-grid\">\n<div class=\"comparison-card bad\">\n<h4>Pathological IR</h4>\n<p>You're eating carbs, your insulin spikes, your muscles don't take up glucose well despite high insulin. Blood sugar stays elevated. Inflammation increases. This is the kind of insulin resistance we associate with metabolic dysfunction.</p>\n<div class=\"status\">🚨 Metabolic Dysfunction</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"comparison-card good\">\n<h4>Physiological IR</h4>\n<p>You're eating carnivore (low carb), your muscles aren't taking up glucose because there's not much glucose around and they don't need it. Insulin is baseline but responsive. This is adaptation.</p>\n<div class=\"status\">✓ Normal Adaptation</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>The tests look similar, but the mechanism is totally different.</p>\n<div class=\"key-difference-box\">\n<h4>The Key Difference</h4>\n<div class=\"difference-grid\">\n<div class=\"difference-item mixed\">\n<div class=\"label\">On Mixed Diet</div>\n<div class=\"desc\">High fasting insulin<br/>+ High fasting glucose</div>\n<div class=\"verdict\">= Pathological</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"difference-arrow\">VS</div>\n<div class=\"difference-item carnivore\">\n<div class=\"label\">On Carnivore</div>\n<div class=\"desc\">Normal fasting glucose<br>+ Slightly elevated insulin</br></div>\n<div class=\"verdict\">= Physiological</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- Inline Image -->\n<figure class=\"inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Bacon and eggs - fat-adapted carnivore meal\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"/images/bacon-and-eggs--800w.webp\" srcset=\"/images/bacon-and-eggs--400w.webp 400w, /images/bacon-and-eggs--800w.webp 800w, /images/bacon-and-eggs--1200w.webp 1200w\"/>\n<figcaption>Your muscles are running on fat, not glucose</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Why Carnivores Have This Adaptation</h2>\n<p>Your muscles spare glucose because there's not much glucose to spare. If your muscles are insulin-sensitive in a high-carb environment, they'll take up glucose greedily, which means blood sugar might drop dangerously low. Your body adapts by being slightly insulin-resistant to preserve blood glucose for your brain.</p>\n<p>This is elegant. It's not broken. It's protective.</p>\n<h2>The Research</h2>\n<p>There's research on this from exercise scientists studying athletes doing very low-carb diets. The findings: yes, you can develop physiological insulin resistance on carnivore. No, it's not concerning. Yes, it goes away if you add carbs back. And yes, the metabolic markers that usually indicate problems (inflammation, triglycerides, LDL particle number) are usually excellent on carnivore despite the insulin resistance.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n                        \"The metabolic markers that usually indicate problems are usually excellent on carnivore despite the insulin resistance. Which suggests the insulin resistance itself isn't the problem.\"\n                    </blockquote>\n<h2>What Your Doctor Might Miss</h2>\n<p>A standard check might show elevated fasting insulin and minimal glucose tolerance. Your doctor might say \"you're insulin resistant\" and suggest you reduce fat or add carbs.</p>\n<div class=\"tests-box\">\n<h4>Ask for These Tests Instead</h4>\n<div class=\"tests-grid\">\n<div class=\"test-item\">\n<div class=\"name\">C-Reactive Protein</div>\n<div class=\"desc\">Inflammation marker</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"test-item\">\n<div class=\"name\">IL-6</div>\n<div class=\"desc\">Inflammatory cytokine</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"test-item\">\n<div class=\"name\">Triglycerides</div>\n<div class=\"desc\">Should be low</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"test-item\">\n<div class=\"name\">LDL Particle Number</div>\n<div class=\"desc\">More important than total LDL</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"test-item\">\n<div class=\"name\">CGM for 1 Week</div>\n<div class=\"desc\">Real glucose stability data</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"test-item\">\n<div class=\"name\">HbA1c</div>\n<div class=\"desc\">3-month glucose average</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"color: #d4a574; margin-top: 15px; font-size: 14px;\">If those are good, the insulin resistance is physiological and protective, not pathological.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>If you're concerned:</strong> Ask for a continuous glucose monitor for a week. See how your glucose actually behaves throughout the day. If it's stable between 70-100, you're fine. If it's bouncing around, something's off. The CGM is more informative than a single test.</p>\n<h2>One Important Caveat</h2>\n<p>This assumes you actually have good carbohydrate tolerance on carnivore. If you eat meat but also eat a bunch of processed food or carbs, you can have both pathological insulin resistance AND carnivore. Don't use \"physiological IR on carnivore\" as an excuse to eat cookies.</p>\n<h2>Will It Reverse If I Eat Carbs Again?</h2>\n<p>Yes. The adaptation reverses in weeks once you reintroduce carbs. Your muscles become insulin-sensitive again because they need to take up glucose for energy. This is why athletes doing carb-cycling don't have permanent insulin resistance changes.</p>\n<h2>Should You Worry?</h2>\n<p>No. Physiological insulin resistance on carnivore is normal. The markers that matter (inflammation, lipids, metabolic health) are usually excellent. If your doctor is concerned, get more detailed testing. But don't automatically assume elevated insulin on a low-carb diet means something's wrong. It usually means something's right.</p>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Same name, different mechanism:</strong> Physiological IR is adaptation, not dysfunction. Your muscles spare glucose for your brain.</li>\n<li><strong>Check the right markers:</strong> Inflammation, triglycerides, and particle counts matter more than the IR label itself.</li>\n<li><strong>Get a CGM:</strong> One week of real glucose data beats a single fasting glucose test for understanding your metabolism.</li>\n<li><strong>It's reversible:</strong> Add carbs back and insulin sensitivity returns in weeks. This isn't permanent damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Feature, not bug:</strong> If your metabolic markers are good and you feel good, the IR is protective and correct.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>—Sarah</p>\n\n</div>",
