  "content_html": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<p>One of the biggest objections to carnivore is cost. \"It's too expensive. I can't afford meat every day.\" Here's what that usually means: you're buying expensive meat.</p>\n<div class=\"tldr-box\">\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>$5-7 per day</strong> — carnivore can be cheaper than most standard diets</li>\n<li><strong>MVP cuts:</strong> ground beef ($3-5/lb), chuck roasts ($2-4/lb), eggs ($2-4/dozen)</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly cost:</strong> $150-200 for meat, $180-240 total with supplements</li>\n<li><strong>Strategy:</strong> buy in bulk, shop sales, stock your freezer, skip premium labels</li>\n<li><strong>Prep hack:</strong> cook 5 lbs ground beef Sunday, eat all week</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>Carnivore doesn't have to be expensive. It can be cheaper than most standard diets. Here's how to do it on a budget.</p>\n<h2>The Cheap Cuts That Work</h2>\n<div class=\"price-grid\">\n<div class=\"price-card\">\n<h4>Ground Beef</h4>\n<span class=\"price-tag\">$3-5/lb</span>\n<p>The MVP of budget carnivore. Fatty ground beef (80/20 or 73/27) is nutrient-dense and versatile. 10-pound chubs at Costco run $3-3.50/lb.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"price-card\">\n<h4>Chuck Roasts</h4>\n<span class=\"price-tag\">$2-4/lb</span>\n<p>Cheap, fatty, forgiving. Throw in a pot, cook slow, eat for days. A 3-pound chuck roast for $8 is a week of meals.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"price-card\">\n<h4>Beef Liver</h4>\n<span class=\"price-tag\">$2-4/lb</span>\n<p>Cheap because people don't want it. More for you. More nutrient-dense than muscle meat. A 1-pound package is often $2-3.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"price-card\">\n<h4>Chicken Thighs</h4>\n<span class=\"price-tag\">$1.50-3/lb</span>\n<p>Cheaper than breasts and have more fat. A rotisserie chicken is $5-7 and provides 3-4 meals.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"price-card\">\n<h4>Canned Fish</h4>\n<span class=\"price-tag\">$1-3/can</span>\n<p>Sardines and mackerel last forever and are nutrient-dense. No prep. No cooking. $2 a meal on sale.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"price-card\">\n<h4>Eggs</h4>\n<span class=\"price-tag\">$2-4/dozen</span>\n<p>Protein and fat. Cheap. A dozen eggs is a week of breakfasts at $0.25-0.35 per egg.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n                        \"The biggest objection to carnivore is cost. Here's what that usually means: you're buying expensive meat.\"\n                    </blockquote>\n<h2>Budget Carnivore Breakdown</h2>\n<div class=\"budget-box\">\n<h3>Daily Meal Cost</h3>\n<div class=\"budget-item\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"meal\">Breakfast</div>\n<div class=\"food\">2-3 eggs</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cost\">$0.50</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"budget-item\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"meal\">Lunch</div>\n<div class=\"food\">½ lb ground beef (80/20)</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cost\">$1.50-2</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"budget-item\">\n<div>\n<div class=\"meal\">Dinner</div>\n<div class=\"food\">Chuck roast or chicken thighs</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"cost\">$2-4</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"budget-total\">\n<span class=\"label\">Daily Total</span>\n<span class=\"amount\">$4-8</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Compare that to most diets, and carnivore is actually cheaper. No processed snacks, no restaurant food, no impulse purchases.</p>\n<!-- Inline Image -->\n<figure class=\"inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Bacon and eggs breakfast\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"/images/bacon-and-eggs--800w.webp\" srcset=\"/images/bacon-and-eggs--400w.webp 400w, /images/bacon-and-eggs--800w.webp 800w, /images/bacon-and-eggs--1200w.webp 1200w\"/>\n<figcaption>Breakfast for $0.50-1.00. Hard to beat.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div class=\"strategy-box\">\n<h4>The Buying Strategy</h4>\n<p><strong>Buy what's on sale.</strong> Costco membership is $60/year and pays for itself in meat savings within two months if you buy in bulk.</p>\n<p><strong>Shop the sales.</strong> Most grocery stores have meat sales every 2-3 weeks. Buy when ground beef hits $3/lb. Stock for three weeks. Skip it when it's $5/lb.</p>\n<p><strong>Stock your freezer.</strong> When prices are good, buy extra. A chest freezer ($150-200) pays for itself within 6 months of strategic buying.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"avoid-box\">\n<h4>What Not to Buy</h4>\n<div class=\"avoid-list\">\n<div class=\"avoid-item\">Grass-fed premium ($2-4 more per pound for negligible difference on a budget)</div>\n<div class=\"avoid-item\">Organic labels (you're only eating the meat, doesn't matter for carnivore)</div>\n<div class=\"avoid-item\">Expensive cuts (ribeye, sirloin, filet) — chuck roast tastes better slow-cooked</div>\n<div class=\"avoid-item\">Single-serving portions (always more expensive per pound)</div>\n<div class=\"avoid-item\">Pre-marinated or pre-seasoned meats (paying for salt and marketing)</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Prep Strategy on a Budget</h2>\n<p><strong>Cook in bulk.</strong> Sunday: brown 5 pounds of ground beef, season with salt. Portion into containers. Eat from containers all week. Takes 30 minutes, saves you cooking every day.</p>\n<p>Or: buy chuck roasts, throw in slow cooker for 8 hours. Meat falls apart. Eat for days. Minimal effort, minimal cost, maximum simplicity.</p>\n<h2>The Monthly Math</h2>\n<div class=\"math-box\">\n<h3>Monthly Budget Breakdown</h3>\n<div class=\"math-grid\">\n<div class=\"math-item\">\n<div class=\"food\">Ground beef @ $3/lb</div>\n<div class=\"price\">$135-180</div>\n<div class=\"per\">1.5-2 lbs/day</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"math-item\">\n<div class=\"food\">Chuck roast @ $3/lb</div>\n<div class=\"price\">$135-180</div>\n<div class=\"per\">1.5-2 lbs/day</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"math-item\">\n<div class=\"food\">Eggs + canned fish</div>\n<div class=\"price\">$100-150</div>\n<div class=\"per\">supplemental</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"math-final\">\n<div class=\"label\">Total Budget Carnivore</div>\n<div class=\"amount\">$150-240/month</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>That's cheaper than most diets when you account for the fact that you're not buying processed snacks, restaurant food, or impulse purchases.</p>\n<h2>Where People Overpay</h2>\n<p>They buy expensive cuts when cheap cuts work just as well. They don't buy in bulk. They don't freeze and plan. They buy single-serving portions. They buy the premium organic grass-fed when regular works fine.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n                        \"Budget carnivore isn't about sacrificing quality. It's about not paying premium prices for unnecessary extras.\"\n                    </blockquote>\n<h2>The Budget-Focused Take</h2>\n<p>Carnivore can be one of the cheapest diets if you buy the right cuts, buy in bulk, and plan ahead. Ground beef, chuck roasts, chicken, eggs, and canned fish will keep you carnivore for $5-7 per day. That's cheaper than eating out once, and you'll feel better than any processed food diet.</p>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Ground beef is MVP:</strong> 80/20 at $3-5/lb provides complete nutrition. Buy 10-lb chubs at Costco for best value.</li>\n<li><strong>Chuck roasts win slow:</strong> $2-4/lb, throw in slow cooker, eat for days. Tastes better than expensive cuts.</li>\n<li><strong>Skip the premiums:</strong> Grass-fed and organic add cost without proportional benefit on a budget.</li>\n<li><strong>Bulk cook Sundays:</strong> 30 minutes of cooking = all week's meals prepped. No daily decisions.</li>\n<li><strong>$150-240/month total:</strong> Cheaper than most diets when you cut the snacks and eating out.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>—Marcus</p>\n\n</div>",
