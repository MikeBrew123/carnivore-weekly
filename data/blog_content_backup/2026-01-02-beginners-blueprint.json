No complexity, no variables.</li>\n<li><strong>The danger zone is days 3-5:</strong> Adaptation kicks in. Electrolytes (especially salt) prevent most \"keto flu\" symptoms.</li>\n<li><strong>30 days minimum:</strong> Give it 30 days before deciding if it works. Most see real changes by day 90.</li>\n<li><strong>Track what matters:</strong> Energy, clothes fit, digestion—not just scale weight.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>If you're thinking \"I want to try carnivore,\" you're not alone. Thirty percent of Reddit's carnivore traffic is people asking: \"What should I eat?\" and \"Will this actually work for me?\"</p>\n<p>Here's what I've learned watching thousands of people start: most fail in week two, not because carnivore doesn't work, but because they didn't know what to expect. Let's fix that.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    \"Most people fail in week two, not because carnivore doesn't work, but because they didn't know what to expect.\"\n</blockquote>\n<h2>Week 0: Before You Start</h2>\n<div class=\"phase-card\" data-phase=\"PREP\">\n<h3>Answer This First: Why Are You Doing This?</h3>\n<p>Not the Instagram answer. The real one. Are you fixing blood sugar crashes? Trying to lose weight? Dealing with digestive issues? Clearing brain fog?</p>\n<p>The answer matters because it changes what success looks like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Fat loss:</strong> Track weight and how clothes fit</li>\n<li><strong>Energy:</strong> Notice afternoon crashes disappearing</li>\n<li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Watch joint pain improve</li>\n<li><strong>Digestion:</strong> Monitor bloating and regularity</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Also: Talk to your doctor.</strong> If you're on medication—especially for blood sugar or blood pressure—you need medical oversight. Carnivore changes how your body processes medication.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Week 1: The Simple Start</h2>\n<p>Your job this week is to prove you can execute the diet. That's it. Not to be perfect. Not to hit perfect macros. Just to eat meat.</p>\n<div class=\"meal-plan\">\n<h3>Week One Meal Plan</h3>\n<div class=\"meal-item\">\n<span class=\"meal-time\">Breakfast</span>\n<span class=\"meal-desc\">6-8 oz ground beef with salt and water</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"meal-item\">\n<span class=\"meal-time\">Lunch</span>\n<span class=\"meal-desc\">8-10 oz steak with salt and water</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"meal-item\">\n<span class=\"meal-time\">Dinner</span>\n<span class=\"meal-desc\">10-12 oz beef roast or ground beef with salt and water</span>\n</div>\n<div class=\"meal-item\">\n<span class=\"meal-time\">Snacks</span>\n<span class=\"meal-desc\">If hungry: more beef, hard-boiled eggs, or canned sardines</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Why beef and salt?</strong> Beef is the most nutrient-dense food available. Salt prevents electrolyte crashes that cause headaches and fatigue. Water keeps everything moving. No complexity. No variables.</p>\n<p><strong>How much to eat:</strong> Until you're satisfied, not stuffed. Your hunger signals will be weird for a few days. That's normal. Listen to satiety, not quantity.</p>\n<!-- Inline Image -->\n<figure class=\"inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Bacon and eggs - simple carnivore meal\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"/images/bacon-and-eggs--800w.webp\" srcset=\"/images/bacon-and-eggs--400w.webp 400w, /images/bacon-and-eggs--800w.webp 800w, /images/bacon-and-eggs--1200w.webp 1200w\"/>\n<figcaption>Keep it simple. Beef, eggs, bacon—nothing complicated in week one.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<div class=\"danger-zone\">\n<h4>⚠️ The Danger Zone: Days 3-5</h4>\n<p>This is when adaptation kicks in. You might feel foggy, tired, or get a headache. This is adaptation, not failure.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Days 1-2:</strong> Probably fine. Some people feel great immediately.</li>\n<li><strong>Days 3-5:</strong> The danger zone. Foggy, tired, headache possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Days 6-7:</strong> Energy usually returns. Sleep might be weird.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>If you get a headache:</strong> Add salt (1/4 teaspoon with water) and eat more. Most \"keto flu\" is dehydration + electrolyte depletion, not the diet failing.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Weeks 2-4: The Adaptation Phase</h2>\n<div class=\"phase-card\" data-phase=\"ADAPT\">\n<h3>Your Body Is Learning</h3>\n<p>This is where your digestive system learns that you're only eating meat. Your gut bacteria shift. Your stomach acid production normalizes. Your liver adjusts to processing fat at scale.</p>\n<p>This takes time. Not magic time. Physiological time.</p>\n</div>\n<p><strong>What changes now:</strong> You can start experimenting. Try different beef sources. Add eggs. Try pork, lamb, or fish. See what feels good. Most people find their preference—all beef, beef + eggs, or beef + fish. All valid.</p>\n<p><strong>Expect:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Energy fluctuations—some days amazing, some tired</li>\n<li>Appetite changes—your body is figuring out fuel needs</li>\n<li>Weird sleep for 3-4 weeks (4 hours or 10 hours—both normal)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>The Electrolyte Reality</h2>\n<div class=\"electrolyte-box\">\n<h3>This Is Where People Fail</h3>\n<p>When you stop eating carbs, your body stops storing sodium (carbs bind water and sodium). You'll pee out water and electrolytes for 2-3 weeks. This is why you feel tired or get headaches.</p>\n<p><strong>The fix:</strong> Salt your food. A lot. More than you think. Aim for <strong>5-10 grams of sodium per day</strong> (1-2 teaspoons of salt) for the first 3-4 weeks.</p>\n<p>Yes, that sounds like a lot. You're not eating carbs, so you're not spiking insulin or retaining excess water. You need the sodium.</p>\n<p><strong>Signs you're low on electrolytes:</strong></p>\n<div class=\"symptom-grid\">\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">Headaches</div>\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">Fatigue</div>\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">Muscle cramps</div>\n<div class=\"symptom-item\">Dizziness</div>\n</div>\n<p style=\"margin-top: 15px;\"><strong>Quick fix:</strong> Salt water (1/4 teaspoon in 8oz water) + food. Usually improves within 30 minutes.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Tracking Progress (The Right Way)</h2>\n<p>Don't just weigh yourself. Weight fluctuates 3-5 lbs daily based on water, hormones, digestion, and sodium. One number tells you almost nothing.</p>\n<div class=\"tracking-grid\">\n<div class=\"tracking-item\">\n<h4>Clothes Fit</h4>\n<p>More accurate than scale. Track waist, chest, arms.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tracking-item\">\n<h4>Energy Levels</h4>\n<p>Rate 1-10 throughout the day. Notice patterns.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tracking-item\">\n<h4>Hunger Patterns</h4>\n<p>Fasting easier? Less snacking? Natural satiety?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tracking-item\">\n<h4>Digestion</h4>\n<p>How are you feeling? Bloating? Regularity?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tracking-item\">\n<h4>Sleep Quality</h4>\n<p>Not duration—quality. Waking rested?</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"tracking-item\">\n<h4>Mental Clarity</h4>\n<p>Is brain fog gone? Focus improved?</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><strong>Take photos</strong> on day 1, day 30, and day 90. You'll see changes the scale won't show.</p>\n<h2>Common Questions</h2>\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<strong>Q: Will my cholesterol get messed up?</strong>\n<p>It might change. Some people's LDL goes up, some goes down. Total cholesterol often goes down. HDL almost always goes up. The important metrics are inflammation markers (triglycerides, apoB, hs-CRP), not total cholesterol. Get blood work at 30 and 90 days.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<strong>Q: How much do I actually need to eat?</strong>\n<p>Until satisfied. That's it. Hunger regulation usually improves after week 2. Most people eat less naturally without trying.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<strong>Q: Is it okay to do this with exercise?</strong>\n<p>Yes, but expect to feel flat for 2-3 weeks while adapting. Your glycogen stores are depleted. After that, many people feel stronger. Some do lighter training during adaptation.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"faq-item\">\n<strong>Q: What if I get digestive issues?</strong>\n<p>Change your approach. Eat smaller meals more frequently. Try ground meat instead of whole cuts. Try different beef sources. Your digestion will adapt, but it takes time.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The 90-Day Checkpoint</h2>\n<p>By day 90, you'll know if this is working. You'll have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adapted metabolically (no more adaptation flu)</li>\n<li>Established your preferred food selections</li>\n<li>Seen measurable changes (weight, energy, how you look/feel)</li>\n<li>Built the habit (it's automatic now)</li>\n<li>Know how your body responds</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you feel dramatically better at day 90, you've found something that works. If not, you have good data about why—and that's also valuable.</p>\n<div class=\"action-box\">\n<h3>What to Do Right Now</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy beef (ground or steak, fatty cuts are better)</li>\n<li>Buy salt</li>\n<li>Plan meals for the next 3 days</li>\n<li>Tell your doctor</li>\n<li>Take a baseline photo and write down how you feel</li>\n<li>Commit to 30 days minimum—not forever, just 30 days</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start simple:</strong> Beef, salt, water. Don't overcomplicate week one.</li>\n<li><strong>Electrolytes matter:</strong> Aim for 5-10g sodium daily during adaptation (weeks 1-4).</li>\n<li><strong>The danger zone is days 3-5:</strong> If you feel bad, add salt and eat more. Don't quit.</li>\n<li><strong>Track what actually matters:</strong> Energy, clothes fit, digestion—not just scale weight.</li>\n<li><strong>Commit to 30 days minimum:</strong> Real adaptation takes 2-4 weeks. Best results at day 90.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>That's it. You're ready.</p>\n<p>—Sarah</p>\n<p class=\"disclaimer\">\n    Not a doctor.
