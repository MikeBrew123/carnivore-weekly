Seven Sons Farms just launched a full line of organs. TruBeef is preparing organ meat products. The community's asking: \"How do I actually cook this? What's the nutrition? Where do I source quality?\"</p>\n<p>We're going to answer all of it.</p>\n<p>—Sarah &amp; Marcus</p>\n<h2>Why Organs Matter (Sarah)</h2>\n<p>Muscle meat is protein and fat. That's good. But organs are nutrient density at a level muscle meat can't touch.</p>\n<p>A 100-gram serving of grass-fed beef liver contains:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Vitamin A (retinol):</strong> 6,421 IU (128% of daily value)</li>\n<li><strong>Vitamin B12:</strong> 60 micrograms (1000% of daily value)</li>\n<li><strong>Folate:</strong> 145 micrograms (36% of daily value)</li>\n<li><strong>Iron:</strong> 5.2 mg (29% of daily value, highly bioavailable form)</li>\n<li><strong>Copper:</strong> 3.8 mg (190% of daily value)</li>\n<li><strong>Selenium:</strong> 36 micrograms (51% of daily value)</li>\n<li><strong>Protein:</strong> 26 grams</li>\n<li><strong>Fat:</strong> 3.6 grams (very lean compared to muscle)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This is why carnivores don't need multivitamins if they eat organs regularly. You're getting micronutrient density that supplements can't match.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\nOne 100-gram serving of liver per week covers most micronutrient bases. You don't need more—you're already over-supplemented at two servings.\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>The practical reality:</strong> One 100-gram serving of liver per week covers most micronutrient bases. Two servings per week and you're over-supplemented on several vitamins.</p>\n<p><strong>Important caveat:</strong> Vitamin A from organ meats is preformed (retinol), not beta-carotene. It's active immediately. Too much can be toxic (though this is rare from food, more common from supplements). Safe upper limit is around 10,000 IU daily. One 100g serving of liver contains 6,400 IU, so you have margin, but don't eat liver daily.</p>\n<h2>The Organ Profile: What Each One Does (Sarah)</h2>\n<div class=\"organ-cards-grid\">\n<div class=\"organ-card organ-card--liver\">\n<div class=\"organ-card-body\">\n<p><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Vitamin A, B12, folate, iron, copper, selenium (highest density).</p>\n<p><strong>Taste/Texture:</strong> Metallic, strong flavor. Dense texture. Texture improves with grinding or pâté format.</p>\n<p><strong>How much:</strong> 100-200g per week maximum. Not daily.</p>\n<p class=\"organ-best-for\"><strong>Best for:</strong> Micronutrient density, especially if you're deficient in iron or B12.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"organ-card organ-card--heart\">\n<div class=\"organ-card-body\">\n<p><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> CoQ10, selenium, B vitamins, iron. Less extreme micronutrient profile than liver, more balanced.</p>\n<p><strong>Taste/Texture:</strong> Mild, slightly gamey. Texture is dense but less \"organ-y\" than liver. Many people prefer it.</p>\n<p><strong>How much:</strong> Can eat more frequently. Heart is essentially a muscle (cardiac muscle), so it's safer to rotate in more.</p>\n<p class=\"organ-best-for\"><strong>Best for:</strong> Cardiovascular support (CoQ10), familiar texture, less extreme nutrient profile.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"organ-card organ-card--kidney\">\n<div class=\"organ-card-body\">\n<p><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Selenium, B vitamins, iron, but less B12 than liver.</p>\n<p><strong>Taste/Texture:</strong> Strong ammonia-like smell if not cleaned properly. Dense, slightly rubbery texture. Not for everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>How much:</strong> 50-100g once or twice per week, if you tolerate it.</p>\n<p class=\"organ-best-for\"><strong>Best for:</strong> Selenium, if you're tolerating it.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"organ-card organ-card--brain\">\n<div class=\"organ-card-body\">\n<p><strong>Micronutrients:</strong> Very high in phospholipids, choline, DHA. Not high in classic vitamins/minerals, but crucial for neurological health.</p>\n<p><strong>Taste/Texture:</strong> Mild, butter-like when cooked. Creamy texture. Many people find it most palatable.</p>\n<p><strong>How much:</strong> 50-100g per week. Enough to get the benefit without excess.</p>\n<p class=\"organ-best-for\"><strong>Best for:</strong> Cognitive function, mood support, neurological health.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h3>Other Organs (Spleen, Thymus, Tongue)</h3>\n<p><strong>Tongue:</strong> Not technically an organ, but often grouped with them. Less intimidating flavor/texture profile. More fat than liver. Good entry point.</p>\n<p><strong>Spleen:</strong> Less nutrient-dense than liver, strong flavor. Not essential.</p>\n<p><strong>Thymus:</strong> High in immune factors. Mild flavor. Decent option if available.</p>\n<h2>The Sourcing Reality (Marcus)</h2>\n<p>Here's the problem: organs from most grocery stores are garbage. They're from concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs). The nutrient profile is different. The flavor is worse. So is the texture.</p>\n<p><strong>Where to source quality organs:</strong></p>\n<h3>Online (Best for Convenience)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>ButcherBox:</strong> Grass-fed beef organs available monthly. Frozen. Ships direct. $40-60 for variety pack. Quality is solid.</li>\n<li><strong>Grassland Beef:</strong> Grass-fed, grass-finished. Organ pâtés and individual organs. Ships frozen. Higher price point ($60-80).</li>\n<li><strong>US Wellness Meats:</strong> Grass-fed organs, variety options. Ships frozen. $50-70 for organs.</li>\n<li><strong>TruBeef:</strong> Newer player, good quality organs. Direct to consumer.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Local (Best for Freshness &amp; Cost)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Local butchers:</strong> Call and ask for organs directly. Often cheaper ($3-8 per pound) because most people don't buy them. Sometimes free if you buy regular meat.</li>\n<li><strong>Farmers markets:</strong> Find grass-fed beef vendors, ask if they have organs available. Often will order for you.</li>\n<li><strong>CSA programs:</strong> Community Supported Agriculture beef shares often include organs as add-ons.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Quality Check:</h3>\n<p>When you get organs, check: color (bright, not gray or dark), smell (should smell like fresh meat, not ammonia), texture (firm, not mushy). If it smells off, it is.</p>\n<h2>Preparation Methods (Marcus)</h2>\n<figure class=\"post-inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Cooking meat in a cast iron skillet\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"/images/lifestyle-cooking-800w.webp\" srcset=\"/images/lifestyle-cooking-400w.webp 400w, /images/lifestyle-cooking-800w.webp 800w, /images/lifestyle-cooking-1200w.webp 1200w\">\n<figcaption>Simple preparation: hot pan, good fat, don't overcook</figcaption>\n</img></figure>\n<h3>Liver (Most Intimidating)</h3>\n<p><strong>The Problem:</strong> Liver tastes strong. Texture is dense. Many people hate it on first try.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution 1: Ground/Pâté (Best for Beginners)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Buy liver pâté or grind raw liver yourself</li>\n<li>Mix 3 parts ground beef to 1 part ground liver</li>\n<li>Cook as burger patties or ground beef dish</li>\n<li>Flavor is diluted, texture is familiar</li>\n<li>Works immediately; no palatability learning curve</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Solution 2: Sliced &amp; Seared (Medium Difficulty)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Slice liver thin (1/4-1/2 inch)</li>\n<li>Pat dry with paper towel</li>\n<li>Season with salt only</li>\n<li>Sear in hot butter/tallow 2-3 minutes per side (medium-rare)</li>\n<li>Don't overcook (gets rubbery)</li>\n<li>Serve immediately</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tip: Cook it fast and don't overcook. Overcooked liver becomes bitter and rubbery. 2 minutes per side, medium-rare, is ideal.</p>\n<p><strong>Solution 3: Liver &amp; Onions (Cheating Slightly)</strong></p>\n<p>If you must add something (though not carnivore-strict), sautéed onions mask the flavor. Liver, onions, salt, butter. Cook liver medium-rare, don't overcook.</p>\n<h3>Heart</h3>\n<p><strong>Method 1: Diced &amp; Stir-Fried</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Cube heart into 1-inch pieces</li>\n<li>Heat butter or tallow until very hot</li>\n<li>Add heart cubes, season with salt</li>\n<li>Stir frequently, cook 6-8 minutes total until outside is browned but inside is medium</li>\n<li>Serve immediately</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Method 2: Whole Grilled</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Slice heart lengthwise into thin steaks (1/2 inch)</li>\n<li>Season with salt</li>\n<li>Grill or sear in hot pan, 3 minutes per side (medium-rare)</li>\n<li>Slice and serve</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Brain</h3>\n<p><strong>Method: Pan-Seared (Simplest)</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Brain is usually pre-cleaned and sliced</li>\n<li>Pat dry</li>\n<li>Sear in hot butter, 2-3 minutes per side</li>\n<li>Season with salt</li>\n<li>Texture becomes creamy when cooked</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>General Rules</h3>\n<p><strong>Temperature:</strong> Don't overcook organs. They toughen and develop off-flavors. Medium-rare is ideal.</p>\n<p><strong>Seasoning:</strong> Salt is usually enough. Some people add black pepper, but keep it simple initially to taste the meat.</p>\n<p><strong>Fat:</strong> Cook in butter or tallow (not seed oil). The fat improves texture and flavor.</p>\n<h2>Integration Into Your Protocol (Sarah &amp; Marcus)</h2>\n<p><strong>For beginners:</strong> Start with heart or brain (more palatable). Add one 100-gram serving per week. If tolerated, gradually add liver.</p>\n<p><strong>For experienced carnivores optimizing:</strong> Rotate organs: heart 1-2x per week, liver 1x per week, brain 1x per week if available. This covers micronutrient bases without excess.</p>\n<p><strong>Storage:</strong> Frozen organs keep 6-12 months. Thaw in refrigerator overnight. Use within 1-2 days of thawing.</p>\n<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness:</strong> Organs cost 50-75% less than quality muscle meat. They're the most nutrient-dense, cheapest option on carnivore.</p>\n<h2>Real Talk</h2>\n<p>You don't have to eat organs to do carnivore successfully. Muscle meat with good fat content works. But if you want maximum nutrient density with minimum food volume, organs are unbeatable.</p>\n<p>The sourcing is getting easier (new brands launching, more availability). The preparation is straightforward once you do it once. The nutrition is undeniable.</p>\n<p>If you've been hesitating: start with heart or brain, try the ground liver method, and see how your body responds. Most people who get past the initial palatability learning curve end up loving organs.</p>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Liver provides unmatched micronutrient density—100g weekly covers B12, iron, vitamin A, and more without needing supplements.</li>\n<li>Start with milder organs (heart, tongue, or brain) before moving to liver if you're new to organ meats.</li>\n<li>Source from grass-fed suppliers (ButcherBox, Grassland Beef, US Wellness) for better nutrient profiles and flavor.</li>\n<li>The ground liver method (mixing 1 part liver to 3 parts ground beef) makes organs approachable for beginners—no learning curve required.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>—Sarah &amp; Marcus</p>\n<p class=\"post-disclaimer\">\n<em>Not a doctor. Organ meats are nutrient-dense and safe in normal quantities, but if you have hemochromatosis (iron overload disorder) or are pregnant, consult healthcare provider about liver consumption. Standard disclaimers apply.</em>\n</p>\n\n</div>",
