  "content_html": "<div class=\"post-content\">\n\n<div class=\"tldr-box\">\n<h3>TL;DR</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It's not the diet causing breakouts:</strong> It's your body eliminating toxins your skin has been storing</li>\n<li><strong>Timeline:</strong> Usually 2-4 weeks, sometimes up to 6 weeks for heavy detox</li>\n<li><strong>It's actually a good sign:</strong> Means your detox systems are working and hormones are rebalancing</li>\n<li><strong>After the purge:</strong> Most people end up with clearer skin than before they started</li>\n<li><strong>Don't quit:</strong> The acne is temporary. The benefits are permanent.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<p>You start carnivore. For the first 3-7 days, everything is amazing. Clear energy, no hunger, mental focus is sharp. Then, around day 5-7, you break out.</p>\n<p>Acne that you haven't had in years, or acne worse than usual. Your first instinct: carnivore is making me break out. You might quit.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    \"Wait. This is usually the opposite of what's happening. This is detox purging, and it's a sign your body is cleaning house.\"\n</blockquote>\n<h2>What Is the Acne Purge?</h2>\n<p>When you drastically change your diet, your body ramps up detoxification. Your liver is working harder. Your skin is eliminating toxins. Your hormones are rebalancing. This all happens at once, and it comes out through your skin.</p>\n<p>The acne isn't carnivore causing breakouts. It's your body eliminating toxins that your skin has been storing.</p>\n<div class=\"mechanism-box\">\n<h4>The Mechanism</h4>\n<p>Your skin is an elimination organ. When your internal systems are detoxifying (liver processing, hormones shifting), the skin pitches in by releasing stuff. Oils, histamines, hormonal byproducts.</p>\n<p>All of this tries to come out, and if it gets trapped in a pore, you get a pimple. It's uncomfortable, but it's not harmful. It's progress.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>The Timeline</h2>\n<div class=\"timeline-box\">\n<h3>Acne Purge Phases</h3>\n<div class=\"timeline-phases\">\n<div class=\"phase purge\">\n<div class=\"phase-marker\">\n<div class=\"phase-dot\"></div>\n<div class=\"phase-line\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"phase-content\">\n<div class=\"phase-title\">Weeks 1-3: The Breakout</div>\n<div class=\"phase-desc\">Peak purging period. Your body is rapidly eliminating stored toxins. This is when skin looks worst but it's the most active detox phase.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"phase improving\">\n<div class=\"phase-marker\">\n<div class=\"phase-dot\"></div>\n<div class=\"phase-line\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"phase-content\">\n<div class=\"phase-title\">Weeks 3-6: Gradual Improvement</div>\n<div class=\"phase-desc\">Breakouts start to subside. New pimples are smaller and less frequent. Your skin is catching up to your internal improvements.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"phase clear\">\n<div class=\"phase-marker\">\n<div class=\"phase-dot\"></div>\n<div class=\"phase-line\"></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"phase-content\">\n<div class=\"phase-title\">Weeks 6-8+: Clear Skin</div>\n<div class=\"phase-desc\">Skin stabilizes. Most people report clearer skin than before carnivore—fewer pimples, less oiliness, smaller pores, better complexion.</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Intensity Varies</h2>\n<div class=\"intensity-box\">\n<h3>What Affects Purge Intensity</h3>\n<div class=\"intensity-item\">\n<span class=\"intensity-level\">🔴</span>\n<div class=\"intensity-text\">\n<strong>Heavy processed food background</strong>\n<span>Lots of sugar, seed oils, and processed carbs = bigger purge. More toxins stored = more coming out.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"intensity-item\">\n<span class=\"intensity-level\">🟡</span>\n<div class=\"intensity-text\">\n<strong>Moderate previous diet</strong>\n<span>Some processed foods but not extreme = moderate purge. A few weeks of breakouts, then improvement.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"intensity-item\">\n<span class=\"intensity-level\">🟢</span>\n<div class=\"intensity-text\">\n<strong>Already eating clean</strong>\n<span>Minimal processed foods before = smaller purge or none at all. Less toxins stored means less to eliminate.</span>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<!-- Inline Image -->\n<figure class=\"inline-image\">\n<img alt=\"Bone broth - supportive during the detox phase\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 400px, (max-width: 900px) 800px, 1200px\" src=\"/images/bone-broth--800w.webp\" srcset=\"/images/bone-broth--400w.webp 400w, /images/bone-broth--800w.webp 800w, /images/bone-broth--1200w.webp 1200w\"/>\n<figcaption>Hydration supports the detox process. Water and bone broth help your body eliminate efficiently.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h2>Why It's Actually a Good Sign</h2>\n<div class=\"good-sign-box\">\n<h4>The Purge Means Your Body Is Responding</h4>\n<p>Your detoxification systems are working. Your hormones are rebalancing (rebalancing always causes temporary disruption). If you didn't break out, your body might be responding less. Some people don't purge, which is fine. But if you do, it's evidence that something is shifting internally.</p>\n</div>\n<p>After the purge clears, skin is usually <strong>better than before</strong>. Clearer, less oily, fewer blackheads. This is the payoff.</p>\n<h2>What to Do (and Not Do)</h2>\n<div class=\"do-dont-grid\">\n<div class=\"do-card\">\n<h4>✓ Do This</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep skin clean</strong> — Wash with plain water or gentle cleanser</li>\n<li><strong>Drink more water</strong> — Support your kidneys and liver</li>\n<li><strong>Salt baths</strong> — Anti-inflammatory and supports skin health (20 min soak)</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid touching your face</strong> — Don't spread bacteria</li>\n<li><strong>Be patient</strong> — Give it 4-6 weeks minimum</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"dont-card\">\n<h4>✗ Don't Do This</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Don't add expensive skincare</strong> — You'll confuse the data</li>\n<li><strong>Don't add supplements</strong> — Let carnivore work on its own first</li>\n<li><strong>Don't aggressively exfoliate</strong> — Your skin is already doing enough</li>\n<li><strong>Don't quit</strong> — The acne is temporary, the benefits are permanent</li>\n<li><strong>Don't change multiple things at once</strong> — Keep variables simple</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2>Individual Variation</h2>\n<p>Some people purge on day 2. Some on day 7. Some don't purge at all. Some purge for 2 weeks, some for 8 weeks. Your baseline skin health, previous diet, overall toxin load, hormonal balance—all matter.</p>\n<p>If you don't purge, you might have had a cleaner starting point or your body is eliminating differently (through other pathways). Both are fine.</p>\n<h2>After the Purge</h2>\n<p>Most people end up with better skin than before they started. Fewer pimples, less oiliness, smaller pores, better complexion overall.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"pull-quote\">\n    \"This usually stabilizes by week 8-12. After that, if you stay on carnivore, skin continues to improve. The acne doesn't come back.\"\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The Reframe</h2>\n<p>The acne purge is uncomfortable, but it's not failure. It's not carnivore making you break out. It's your body detoxifying and rebalancing. It's progress. It's temporary. And on the other side of it is usually the clearest skin you've had in years.</p>\n<div class=\"key-takeaways\">\n<h3>Key Takeaways</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The purge is detox, not damage:</strong> Your body is eliminating toxins through your skin—a normal elimination organ</li>\n<li><strong>Timeline is predictable:</strong> Breakout weeks 1-3, improving weeks 3-6, clear by weeks 6-8</li>\n<li><strong>Intensity matches your starting point:</strong> More processed food before = bigger purge</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it simple:</strong> Don't add products or supplements. Just eat carnivore, hydrate, and wait</li>\n<li><strong>Don't quit:</strong> Give it 4-6 weeks minimum before judging. The payoff is worth it</li>\n<li><strong>The purge is a feature, not a bug:</strong> It means your body is working correctly</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<p>If you break out when you start carnivore, it's probably the purge. Give it 4 weeks minimum before judging. Keep skin clean, hydrate, and wait. By week 6-8, skin clarity returns and usually improves. The purge is a feature, not a bug. It means your body is working correctly.</p>\n<p>—Casey</p>\n\n</div>",
