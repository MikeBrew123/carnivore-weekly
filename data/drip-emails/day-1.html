        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Welcome. Let's keep this simple.</h2>

            <p>Hey there,</p>

            <p>You signed up for the 7-Day Carnivore Starter Plan, and I'm genuinely glad you did. Over the next week, I'm going to walk you through everything you need to know to get started. No fluff. No overwhelming science dumps. Just the stuff that actually matters when you're starting out.</p>

            <p>Here's what I want you to know right now: carnivore is the simplest way of eating you'll ever try. That's not marketing. It's just true. There's no calorie counting. No macros to track. No meal timing to obsess over. You eat meat. You add salt. You drink water.</p>

            <p>That's it. Seriously.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p style="margin:0; color: #ffd700; font-weight: bold;">Your Day 1 game plan:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Eat beef. Ground beef, steaks, roasts. Whatever you like, whatever you can afford.</li>
                    <li>Salt your food generously. More than you think you need.</li>
                    <li>Drink water when you're thirsty. Don't force it.</li>
                    <li>Eggs and butter are your friends if you want some variety.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>That's the entire plan for today. I know it sounds too easy, and you might be wondering about vegetables, or fiber, or vitamins. We'll get to all of that. But right now, none of it matters as much as this: just eat meat and stop overthinking it.</p>

            <p>If you want the full roadmap for your first month, I wrote a <a href="https://carnivoreweekly.com/blog/beginners-complete-blueprint-30-days-carnivore.html" style="color: #ffd700;">Beginner's Blueprint</a> that covers everything. But don't feel like you need to read it today. This week is about keeping it simple.</p>

            <p>The people who succeed with carnivore are the ones who start simple. They don't try to build the perfect meal plan on day one. They grab a pound of ground beef, cook it up with salt and butter, eat until they're full, and call it done.</p>

            <p>One more thing. You might feel great today. You might not. Both are normal. Tomorrow I'll tell you exactly what to expect in the first few days, because there's a rough patch that scares off a lot of people, and I don't want that to be you.</p>

            <div class="signature">
                <p>Talk tomorrow,</p>
