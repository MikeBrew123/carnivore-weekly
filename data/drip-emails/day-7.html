            <h1>🥩 CARNIVORE WEEKLY</h1>
            <div class="subtitle">7-Day Carnivore Starter Plan | Day 7 of 7</div>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>You did it. Now let's make it stick.</h2>

            <p>Hey,</p>

            <p>Seven days. You stuck with it. That might not sound like a big deal to someone on the outside, but you and I both know what it took. You pushed through the cravings, the weird looks, the fatigue, and probably a few moments where you wondered if this was worth it.</p>

            <p>It is. And you're about to find out just how much.</p>

            <p>Let me give you the quick version of everything we covered this week:</p>

            <div class="recap-box">
                <h3>Your 7-day recap</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Day 1:</strong> Keep it simple. Beef, salt, water. That's the foundation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 2:</strong> The adaptation phase is temporary. Fatigue, headaches, cravings. All normal. All passing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 3:</strong> Your shopping list fits on an index card. Ground beef, eggs, butter, salt.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 4:</strong> Eat more fat. Seriously. This is the fix for most early problems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 5:</strong> Energy, mental clarity, better sleep. They're coming. Some hit sooner, some later.</li>
                    <li><strong>Day 6:</strong> You can eat anywhere. And you don't owe anyone an explanation.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>So what now?</h3>

            <p>The first week is about survival. Getting through it. Now you're in a position to think about what comes next.</p>

            <p>Some questions you might be asking:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>How much should I actually be eating based on my size and goals?</li>
                <li>Should I be adding organ meats? Which ones? How much?</li>
                <li>What about dairy, eggs, seafood? When do I start expanding?</li>
                <li>Am I getting enough nutrients with just meat?</li>
                <li>How do I optimize this for fat loss, muscle gain, or managing a health condition?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These are real questions, and the answers are different for everyone. Your body composition, your activity level, your health history, and your goals all matter. A 140-pound woman trying to heal autoimmune issues needs a completely different approach than a 220-pound guy training for a powerlifting meet.</p>

            <p>That's exactly why we built the Carnivore Calculator.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p style="margin: 0;">It takes about 3 minutes. You answer a few questions about your body, your goals, and your current situation. Then it gives you a personalized carnivore protocol, including what to eat, how much, and what to focus on based on where you're starting from.</p>
            </div>

            <a href="https://carnivoreweekly.com/calculator.html?utm_source=drip&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=starter-plan&utm_content=day7" class="cta-button">Get Your Personalized Carnivore Protocol</a>
            <p class="cta-description">Takes 3 minutes. Built on real nutritional science.</p>

            <p>Whether you use the calculator or not, here's what matters most: don't stop now. The first week is the hardest, and you already did it. Week two is easier. Week three is when people start texting their friends about how good they feel.</p>

            <p>I'm proud of you for getting here. Most people never make it past Day 3.</p>

            <p>You did.</p>

            <div class="signature">
                <p>Rooting for you,</p>
