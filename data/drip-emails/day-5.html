            <div class="subtitle">7-Day Carnivore Starter Plan | Day 5 of 7</div>
        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>This is where it gets good.</h2>

            <p>Hey,</p>

            <p>If you've made it to Day 5, you're past the hardest part. And if you're reading this thinking "I don't feel any different yet," hold on. For some people, the shift is gradual. For others, they wake up one morning and it hits them all at once. Either way, here's what's coming.</p>

            <p>I want to give you a realistic timeline, not a sales pitch. Everyone's body is different, but here's what most people experience and roughly when:</p>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <p class="timeline-label">Days 5-7: Steady energy</p>
                <p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0;">The afternoon crash disappears. You know that 2 PM slump where you'd reach for coffee or a snack? Gone. Your energy stops spiking and crashing because you're not on the blood sugar rollercoaster anymore. It just stays... level. All day.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <p class="timeline-label">Week 2: Mental clarity</p>
                <p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0;">This is the one people talk about most. The brain fog lifts. You can focus for longer. Conversations feel sharper. Some people describe it as feeling like someone cleaned a dirty windshield they didn't know was dirty. Your brain runs really well on ketones.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <p class="timeline-label">Weeks 2-3: Sleep changes</p>
                <p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0;">You might find yourself waking up before your alarm, actually rested. Deep sleep tends to improve. Some people need less total sleep but feel more recovered. It's one of those things you don't notice until someone points it out.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <p class="timeline-label">Weeks 3-4: Inflammation drops</p>
                <p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Joint pain eases up. Skin starts clearing. Bloating goes away. Puffy face tightens up. If you have any chronic aches, pay attention. A lot of people are stunned by how much better they feel once systemic inflammation calms down.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="timeline-item">
                <p class="timeline-label">Month 2+: Body composition</p>
                <p style="margin: 8px 0 0 0;">Fat loss happens without trying for most people. Not because of calorie restriction, but because your appetite naturally regulates. You eat when you're hungry, stop when you're full, and your body starts finding its natural set point.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p style="margin:0; color: #ffd700; font-weight: bold;">A word of caution:</p>
                <p style="margin: 10px 0 0 0;">Don't chase the scale this early. Weight can fluctuate a lot in the first few weeks as water retention shifts. Focus on how you feel, how your clothes fit, and how you sleep. The scale will catch up.</p>
            </div>

            <p>The point of all this isn't to hype you up. It's to give you something concrete to look forward to. We collected <a href="https://carnivoreweekly.com/blog/real-2-week-results-carnivore.html" style="color: #ffd700;">real 2-week results from actual people</a> if you want to see what others experienced at this stage. Because when you're on Day 3 and your coworker is eating pizza in front of you, it helps to know that steady, clear-headed energy is right around the corner.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow we tackle the social side. What do you say when someone asks why you're not eating the bread? What do you order at a restaurant? It's easier than you think.</p>
