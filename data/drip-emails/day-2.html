            <h2>Let's talk about the rough patch.</h2>

            <p>Hey,</p>

            <p>I promised I'd be honest with you, so here it is: the first 3 to 7 days of eating carnivore can be uncomfortable. Some people breeze through it. Most don't. And the ones who quit almost always quit during this window because they think something is wrong.</p>

            <p>Nothing is wrong. Your body is switching fuel sources.</p>

            <p>For years, maybe decades, you've been running on glucose from carbs. Now you're asking your body to run on fat instead. That transition takes a few days, and while it's happening, you might notice some things:</p>

            <div class="symptom-item">
                <p><span class="symptom-name">Fatigue and brain fog.</span> You might feel like you're running on empty. This is your brain adjusting to using ketones instead of glucose. It passes. Usually by day 4 or 5.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="symptom-item">
                <p><span class="symptom-name">Headaches.</span> Almost always an electrolyte issue. You're losing more sodium than usual because lower insulin means your kidneys flush water and sodium faster. The fix is simple: more salt. Put it on everything. Some people even drink a cup of broth or dissolve a half teaspoon of salt in water.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="symptom-item">
                <p><span class="symptom-name">Cravings.</span> Sugar cravings can hit hard, especially in the evenings. This isn't hunger. It's habit. Your gut bacteria that thrived on sugar are essentially throwing a tantrum. They'll quiet down.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="symptom-item">
                <p><span class="symptom-name">Digestive changes.</span> Things might speed up. Things might slow down. Both are normal. Your gut is adjusting to a completely different type of food. Give it a week before you worry about anything.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p style="margin:0; color: #ffd700; font-weight: bold;">Your survival kit for the rough patch:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li>Salt. Lots of it. Seriously, more than that.</li>
                    <li>Water. Stay hydrated but don't overdo it.</li>
                    <li>Eat enough. This is not the time to restrict calories.</li>
                    <li>Sleep. Your body is doing real work right now. Rest when you can.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Here's what I want you to remember: this is temporary. Every single person who stuck it out past the first week says the same thing. They woke up one morning and felt different. Better. Clearer. More energy than they'd had in years.</p>

            <p>I put together a <a href="https://carnivoreweekly.com/blog/2026-02-08-adaptation-timeline.html" style="color: #ffd700;">week-by-week adaptation timeline</a> if you want to see exactly what's coming. Spoiler: it gets a lot better from here.</p>

            <p>You're not broken. You're adapting. And you're almost through the hardest part.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow I'm sending you a dead-simple shopping list so you don't have to think about what to buy. Just print it and go.</p>
