        <div class="content">
            <h2>Almost everyone gets this wrong.</h2>

            <p>Hey,</p>

            <p>If I could sit down with every person who's ever tried carnivore and give them one piece of advice, it would be this:</p>

            <div class="mistake-box">
                <p>You're not eating enough fat.</p>
            </div>

            <p>I know. It sounds wrong. We've spent our whole lives being told that fat is bad. Low-fat yogurt. Lean chicken breast. Trim the fat off your steak. That messaging is so deeply baked into us that even when people go carnivore, they instinctively reach for the leanest meat they can find.</p>

            <p>And then they feel terrible. They're tired. They're hungry two hours after eating. They get headaches and muscle cramps. And they think carnivore doesn't work.</p>

            <p>It works. They're just accidentally starving themselves.</p>

            <p>Fat is your primary fuel source now. Without enough of it, your body can't make the energy it needs. Protein alone won't cut it. In fact, eating too much protein without enough fat can cause something called "rabbit starvation," where your body struggles to process all that protein without adequate fat to go with it.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p style="margin:0; color: #ffd700; font-weight: bold;">Three mistakes that trip up beginners:</p>
                <ul style="margin-top: 10px;">
                    <li><strong>Not enough fat.</strong> Choose 80/20 ground beef over 90/10. Pick ribeye over sirloin. Cook with butter, not cooking spray. If your plate looks lean, add more fat.</li>
                    <li><strong>Not enough salt.</strong> Your sodium needs go up on carnivore because your insulin drops and your kidneys excrete more sodium. Salt every meal heavily. If you get a headache or feel dizzy, try a pinch of salt in water before anything else.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forcing variety too early.</strong> You don't need five different proteins at every meal. Beef, salt, water. That's enough for the first couple weeks. Adding chicken, pork, fish, and organ meats can come later once you've adapted. Keep it boring. Boring works.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Here's a quick test. After you eat, do you feel satisfied and full for 4 to 6 hours? If yes, you're eating enough. If you're hungry again in 2 hours, you probably need more fat at your meals. Add a tablespoon of butter to your ground beef. Choose the fattier cut. Don't trim anything.</p>

            <p>This one change, eating more fat, fixes about 80% of the problems beginners run into. It's that important. And if the headaches or muscle cramps are hitting you, read our <a href="https://carnivoreweekly.com/blog/2026-01-04-electrolyte-deficiency-part-1.html" style="color: #ffd700;">electrolyte deep dive</a> — it explains exactly why sodium matters so much right now.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow I'm going to talk about something more fun: when the good stuff starts to kick in. Because it will, and it's worth knowing what to look for.</p>

            <div class="signature">
                <p>Eat the fat,</p>
