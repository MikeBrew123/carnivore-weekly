            <h2>The social survival guide.</h2>

            <p>Hey,</p>

            <p>Let's be honest. The hardest part of carnivore isn't the food. It's other people.</p>

            <p>Your mom is going to worry. Your coworker is going to have opinions. Your friend is going to send you an article about why red meat causes everything bad. And at some point, someone is going to watch you eat a steak with butter and say, "That can't be healthy."</p>

            <p>Here's how to handle all of it without losing your mind.</p>

            <h3>Eating out</h3>

            <p>Every restaurant on earth can feed you. Here's your cheat sheet:</p>

            <div class="restaurant-tip">
                <p><strong>Steakhouse:</strong> You're home. Order a ribeye or NY strip. Ask for extra butter. Skip the sides or ask for a side of bacon instead.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="restaurant-tip">
                <p><strong>Burger joint:</strong> Bunless burgers with cheese and bacon. Most places will wrap it in lettuce or serve it in a bowl. Just ask.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="restaurant-tip">
                <p><strong>Mexican:</strong> Fajita meat without the tortillas. Carne asada. Carnitas. Just the meat, please.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="restaurant-tip">
                <p><strong>Breakfast spot:</strong> Eggs, bacon, sausage. Hold the toast, potatoes, and pancakes. Nobody blinks at this order.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="restaurant-tip">
                <p><strong>Italian:</strong> This one's trickier. Look for grilled chicken, steak, or seafood entrees. Most Italian places have a protein-forward section on the menu.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="restaurant-tip">
                <p><strong>Fast food (in a pinch):</strong> Bunless burgers from anywhere. McDonald's, Five Guys, Wendy's. They'll all do it. No judgment.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Handling questions from family and friends</h3>

            <p>You don't owe anyone a nutritional dissertation. Here are some responses that work:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <ul style="margin: 0;">
                    <li>"I'm trying something new and seeing how I feel." (Vague and un-arguable.)</li>
                    <li>"My doctor suggested I try an elimination diet." (True if you're eliminating everything except meat.)</li>
                    <li>"I just feel better eating this way." (Hard to argue with how someone feels.)</li>
                    <li>Or my personal favorite: just eat your food and don't bring it up. Most people won't notice unless you announce it.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <p>Here's the thing I've learned after years of coaching: the less you talk about your diet, the easier it gets. You don't need to convert anyone. You don't need to defend your choices at Thanksgiving dinner. Just eat your turkey and let your results do the talking.</p>

            <p>If someone genuinely wants to learn, share your experience. If they want to argue, change the subject. Your energy is better spent on your own health than on convincing people who've already made up their minds.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow is the last email in this series, and I have something special for you. You've made it through the hardest week, and I want to help you figure out what comes next.</p>
