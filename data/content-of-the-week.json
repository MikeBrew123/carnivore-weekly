      "commentary": "Yo, Max just dropped some serious metabolic science that every carnivore needs to hear. He's taking on those tired myths about our diet supposedly causing diabetes, and breaking down exactly why those claims don't hold up under real metabolic research. The personal stories in the comments - like the 66-year-old who reversed diabetes - aren't just anecdotes, they're living proof that understanding insulin and nutrition can completely transform health.",

      "commentary": "Okay, holy wow - this video is basically carnivore validation season, and Max just dropped a truth bomb that's gonna shake up everything we thought we knew about nutrition. The study he's breaking down looks legit, showing how whole animal foods can seriously transform health markers in ways most doctors won't even talk about. Personal stories in the comments hit different too - seeing folks heal from years of chronic issues just by changing what's on their plate is powerful stuff. It's not just another diet trend, it's people reclaiming their health one steak at a time.",

The creator's journey through 380 days of primarily meat-based eating shows incredible dedication, especially for mental health improvements. What's cool here isn't just the perfectly seared Canadian beef shoulder, but how someone's experimenting with diet as a potential mental wellness strategy - and documenting every juicy step for the community to learn from.",

      "commentary": "Alright, another day in the carnivore trenches showing how simple and satisfying meat can be. This Japanese creator is crushing their mental health journey with straight-up butter and steak, proving you don't need fancy diets or complicated meal plans to feel good. The butter and rosemary combo is legit - something I tell my coaching clients all the time about keeping meals tasty and nutrient-dense. Some people overthink nutrition, but these clips remind us that great food can be stupid simple: quality meat, good fat, zero stress.",

Abellybely's video perfectly captures the real-world challenge of making this lifestyle work: finding the right protein sources that click with your body and taste preferences.
