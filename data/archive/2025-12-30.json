    "weekly_summary": "Hey friend, how are you feeling as we head into 2026? This week in the carnivore space has been all about fresh starts and honest conversations. I'm seeing a beautiful mix of practical blueprint content (Anthony Chaffee and Steak and Butter Gal both dropped comprehensive \"if I started today\" guides) alongside some really vulnerable discussions about the messy middle of this journey. What struck me most? The community is maturing. People aren't just talking about weight loss anymore. They're tracking <a href=\"wiki.html#electrolytes\" style=\"color: #8b4513; text-decoration: none;\">electrolyte balance</a>, discussing the nuances of different meat sources, and most importantly, being honest about the non-linear nature of healing.\n\nCourtney Luna's candid Q&A about her own journey off strict carnivore really resonated with viewers, while Ken Berry sparked important discussions about nutrient diversity (spoiler: you can't actually thrive on beef alone long-term). The vitamin B1 conversation was particularly fascinating from a bio-optimization standpoint. If you're tracking your health markers like I do with my continuous glucose monitor, this week's content offered some solid data points to consider. The undertone? This isn't about perfection. It's about finding your sustainable path to healing.\n\n-Sarah",

        "answer": "Hey there! When it comes to balancing fat and protein on a carnivore diet, it's all about understanding your body's unique metabolic signals. Research suggests that the ideal macronutrient ratio can vary based on individual factors like activity level, metabolic health, and personal goals.\n\nUsing continuous glucose monitors and tracking ketone levels can help you dial in your specific needs. A good starting point is aiming for approximately 70-80% of calories from fat, with protein around 20-30%. Symptoms like persistent hunger, energy crashes, or difficulty maintaining ketosis might indicate you're not hitting the right fat-to-protein balance.\n\nRecent metabolic research indicates that protein intake beyond 1.6-2.2 grams per kg of body weight can potentially trigger gluconeogenesis, which might bump you out of the metabolic state you're seeking. My recommendation? Start tracking your biomarkers. Tools like Levels CGM or Oura Ring can give you real-time insights into how different macronutrient ratios impact your metabolism.",

        "question": "Why do I feel worse after starting carnivore (oxalate dumping)?",
        "answer": "Hey there. First, I want to validate what you're experiencing. The initial phases of dietary shifts, especially something as significant as carnivore, can feel overwhelming. 'Oxalate dumping' is a complex biochemical process that some people report during major dietary transitions.\n\n    Research suggests that when you dramatically reduce plant-based foods and increase animal proteins, your body undergoes significant metabolic adaptation. Some individuals experience temporary symptoms like fatigue, skin changes, or mild inflammation as your cellular detoxification pathways recalibrate. This isn't necessarily harmful, but it's your body's way of processing a radical nutritional shift.\n\n    From a bio-hacking perspective, I recommend tracking your biomarkers closely.

        "question": "Is it okay to include pork and other meats beyond beef?",
        "answer": "Hey there, health explorer! When we're talking about expanding your carnivore diet beyond beef, the research gets really fascinating. Pork and other meats can absolutely be part of a nutrient-dense protein strategy, but it's critical to understand their unique nutritional profiles.\n\nPork, for instance, offers a different micronutrient profile compared to beef. It's rich in thiamine, selenium, and zinc, which can complement your current nutritional intake. Research from the Journal of Animal Science suggests that meat diversity can actually enhance overall nutrient absorption. My Oura ring data has consistently shown that varied protein sources seem to support more stable energy markers.\n\nThat said, quality matters immensely. I always recommend choosing pasture-raised, minimally processed meats. Grass-fed beef and heritage breed pork tend to have better omega-3 to omega-6 ratios, which can support your inflammatory response and metabolic flexibility.",

        "question": "How do I manage electrolytes properly without feeling awful?",
        "answer": "Hey there! I totally get how tricky electrolyte management can be, especially when you're exploring a high-protein diet approach. Research suggests that when dramatically shifting nutritional intake, your body's sodium, potassium, and magnesium balance gets disrupted.\n\nMost people on carnivore or ketogenic diets experience 'keto flu' symptoms primarily due to electrolyte imbalances. Your body essentially dumps water and minerals during metabolic adaptation. I recommend targeted supplementation: aim for 3-5g sodium, 1-2g potassium, and 300-500mg magnesium daily. My Oura Ring tracking actually helped me notice precise mineral depletion patterns during my own metabolic transitions.\n\nThe key is gradual adaptation. Don't just dump salt randomly - track your body's response. Consider using electrolyte powders without artificial sweeteners, and monitor how you feel. Blood glucose tracking (I'm a huge fan of continuous glucose monitors) can provide real-time insights into your metabolic response.",

        "question": "Can I still be successful if I'm not 100% strict carnivore?",
        "answer": "Hey there! I totally get where you're coming from with this carnivore diet curiosity. The good news is that dietary approaches aren't about perfection - they're about finding what works for YOUR unique body and healing journey.\n\nResearch suggests that flexibility can actually be a strength in nutritional strategies. A 2020 study in Nutrients showed that even 'modified' carnivore approaches can deliver metabolic benefits. What matters most is nutrient density and how your body responds. I've seen clients get incredible results by being around 80% consistent, rather than trying to be 100% rigid.\n\nMy recommendation? Use blood glucose tracking (I'm a big fan of continuous monitors like Levels or Abbott's FreeStyle Libre) to understand how different protein and fat ratios impact YOUR individual metabolism. Everyone's biochemistry is different, so personalized data trumps one-size-fits-all dogma.",

        "question": "What about vitamin B1 and other nutrients on beef-only?",
        "answer": "Hey there! When we're talking about a beef-only diet and vitamin B1 (thiamine), there are some critical nutritional considerations to unpack. Research suggests that while beef contains some thiamine, a carnivore diet might put you at risk for potential deficiencies.\n\nBeef isn't the most robust source of vitamin B1, and a strict carnivore approach could lead to marginal intake. Most beef provides around 0.04-0.06 mg of thiamine per 100g, which is significantly lower than recommended daily intake (1.1-1.2 mg for adults). My tracker data from continuous glucose monitoring and blood panels shows nutrient diversity is key - and beef alone might not hit those optimization markers.\n\nWhat's fascinating is how individual metabolic responses can vary. While some bio-hackers report feeling incredible on carnivore protocols, the long-term nutritional profile requires careful monitoring. I'd recommend regular blood work, potentially supplementing with a high-quality B-complex, and tracking biomarkers through platforms like Levels or InsideTracker to understand your personal metabolic response.",

        "question": "How long does the adaptation period really take?",
        "answer": "Hey there! When it comes to the carnivore diet adaptation period, most people report significant metabolic shifts between 4-12 weeks. My Oura ring and continuous glucose monitoring have helped me track some fascinating metabolic transitions during similar nutritional protocols.\n\n    Research suggests the initial adaptation isn't just about diet - it's a complex metabolic recalibration. Your body transitions from glucose metabolism to primarily fat and protein oxidation, which can trigger significant physiological changes. Folks often experience temporary symptoms like fatigue, electrolyte fluctuations, and metabolic recalibration during this window. I always recommend working with a healthcare professional and tracking key biomarkers like inflammation markers, lipid panels, and glucose response.\n\n    The critical piece is understanding individual variation. While some people report feeling remarkable within 4-6 weeks, others might take 10-12 weeks to fully adapt. Your unique metabolic profile, existing health status, and genetic factors play massive roles in how quickly your body transitions.",

        "question": "Is dairy preventing my progress?",
        "answer": "Hey there! When it comes to dairy and its potential impact on your health journey, the research is nuanced. Recent studies suggest that dairy's effects can vary dramatically based on individual metabolic responses and gut microbiome composition.\n\n    A fascinating area of emerging research looks at how dairy proteins, particularly casein and whey, interact with individual inflammatory markers. Some people experience increased insulin response and inflammatory signals, while others metabolize dairy quite efficiently. My recommendation is always to track your personal biomarkers. Tools like continuous glucose monitors (I'm a big fan of the latest Levels CGM technology) can give real-time insight into how different dairy products impact your unique metabolic profile.\n\n    For those following stricter protocols like carnivore or ketogenic diets, full-fat dairy from grass-fed sources often shows more promising metabolic outcomes. Specifically, fermented options like kefir or aged cheeses tend to have lower lactose and potentially more beneficial probiotic profiles.",

For those who are thinking of trying that with this or any other recipe, do it first with a small batch and lay them out in a single layer on something easy to take in and out of the freezer. Getting the surface of them frozen makes them less likely to stick together once they are in a container. Worst case scenario is that the recipe does not lend itself well to freezing and the patties crumble. you can than use those crumbly bits as a browned ground meat substitute in a lot of other dishes so nothing goes to waste.",

A notable case of this is back in 2007 when a radioshow held a contest where contestants were asked to drink as much water as they could without peeing. A woman died from water intoxication after drinking 7.6 litres.\n\nTo put this in other words. You would die from water intoxication long before you got a lethal dose of aspartame from drinking diet soda.",

              "text": "Meat is digested in the stomach with strong acid, while plants are fermented in the gut.\n\nIf you only eat plants, you don’t need high stomach acid, so your body stops making it. This becomes a problem if you start eating meat again because you won’t have enough acid to digest it. The fix is to gradually increase meat consumption so your stomach acid production ramps up again.\n\nYou also need bile to digest animal fats. If you’re not eating fat, your bile flow slows, bile thickens into sludge and gallstones can form. When you suddenly reintroduce fat, you may not digest it well because your bile ducts can be blocked. To get bile flowing again, bile salts and gradually increasing animal fat can help.\n\nBile is released from the gallbladder when you eat fat and it’s not just for fat digestion. Bile salts also act as a natural intestinal lubricant and mild laxative, keeping stool soft and triggering the muscular contractions that move waste along. Low bile output makes stool drier, harder and slower to pass.\n\nIf you’re sensitive to histamine, source non-hung/aged meat straight from a slaughterhouse.\n\nA plant-based, low-animal-fat diet is not good for long-term health, despite what’s promoted. Humans are designed to eat meat and animal fats.  Things start breaking down when we don’t.",

Please don't stop what you do as it's one of the few \"strong\" pushes for a good way to eat and stop this unhealthy train continuing to go off the rails.  I had a severe blood clot (2ft long) and almost lost my leg.  Found out I was Type 2 Diabetic (A1C 9.2) and very unhealthy.

About two months ago I switched to the air fryer. I put the steak in the air fryer, put some bacon drippings over the top of each steak (luckily my local butcher makes his own bacon and sells the bacon drippings), salt on top and then cook it to my liking. It goes on the plate and then I pour the dripping from the air fryer over the top on my meat like a sauce and it is delicious. Easy clean up and no messy stove. Just enjoying sharing what works for me. Cheers from Australia.",

              "text": "6 years carnivore December 12th 2025. What i wish i knew when i started was how important salt is on a low carb/zero carb/carnivore lifestyle. And i started because i felt like my lifelong epilepsy was killing me slowly. Nothing was working, and after seeing a dr and her telling me i needed antidepressants, i realised i wasn't going to get any help from my dr and i'd have to figure my health out for myself. After some research i came upon carnivore and it changed my life. I came from a standard western diet (uk) from childhood to teen, then to a bodybuilders diet through my mid 20s to thirties - which i would call plant based and low fat - and is where i felt my absolute worst, and then carnivore from age 40. I'm 46 now. And like i said earlier. Carnivore changed my life!!\nBut i didn't know that salt would be so important and possibly the reason why i developed epilepsy in the first place. My mum told me she never used salt in her cooking - and still doesn't (and she's always suffering something🤦🏾‍♀️) i had absences when i was a child and full blown seizures after i started my periods. When i think back to my past, i don't remember much because i was always sick. I never felt well within myself. And so when i dig deeper into this carnivore diet, different branches of information lead back to how i felt as a youngster and lightbulbs are going off!! Could a lack of salt have caused this? Why do i have seizures on my period mostly, and why does salt always make me feel better straight away? I never added it all together until nearly 6 years in because i thought stopping the seizures was all about the fat - and it wasn't! At least for me! High fat carnivore drastically reduced the seizures to almost nothing but adding/supplementing salt - was the cherry on top! The bow that tied it all together! This has blown my mind! And salt isn't just important for me and my epilepsy, its important for human health overall and i believe everybody should be using it daily. Dr Chaffee... i tell ya, if i knew this when i started... life changing. Meat, fat and plenty of salt guys. This is all we need.",

Really concerning at the time and I couldn't find any information about it. Eventually it just disappeared.\nAfter hearing you mention this, I searched again and it's well-documented now. It's caused by excess protein breakdown during adaptation. Your body produces ammonia as a byproduct, and during transition it gets released through sweat and breath.\nGood news: it's temporary and normal. Typically resolves within weeks to months once you're fat-adapted.\nIf anyone else is experiencing this, don't panic. Stay hydrated, keep electrolytes balanced (especially potassium), and eat enough fat relative to protein. Your body is just adapting.\nHope this helps someone going through it right now.",

I was plant based for most of my life. I didn’t think meat was necessary. That I was being kind to animals…now I’m being kind to myself and being more grateful for my food, and I know meat is necessary. I don’t need anything else. Fatty meat, eggs, a bit of dairy here and there, salt, water. Thank you Dr Chaffee. I eat way more calories than I used 2000-3000 a day. I just listen to my body and eat when I feel hunger and I am very lean. I’m usually hungry once a day in the afternoon. Sometimes again in the evening if I had a workout earlier or if my cycle is coming on and I crave more fat. My skin is glowing. I had so much clogged pores before always squeezing out sebum. I’m not craving food at all multiple times a day because of insulin spikes or drops. Just real hunger where food tastes savory again and not binging from messed up signals. Everytime I have tried to eat plants again my gut hurts and I get gas, feel nauseous and my skin starts having issues. Funny how many people think I’m crazy and won’t eat plants. I’m the canary in the coal mine. My gut will scream if there is anything it does not like and knows is toxic. People say oh you just need to get back to a place of healing. When your gut heals enough eat plants again. Why would I eat what caused the issues in the first place. You’re all missing the point of plant toxins. Just because something is high in vitamin c, or potassium, doesn’t mean it isn’t full of other bad things.",

          "description": "🍓⚠️ Are raspberries actually as healthy as we think?\nIn this clip, Dave Asprey breaks down why some fruits — especially certain berries — may cause issues for some people due to oxalates, compounds that can bind to calcium and form sharp microscopic crystals in the body.\n\nThis conversation explores how oxalate-rich foods may impact urinary health, inflammation, and sensitivity in some individuals, and why berries like blueberries are often considered a gentler option. Not all fruit affects the body the same way — and understanding these differences can help you make smarter, more personalized nutrition choices.\n\nTopics covered:\n🧬 Oxalates & calcium binding\n🍓 Raspberries vs blueberries\n🦠 Microscopic crystals\n🚻 Urinary & bladder sensitivity\n⚡ Personalized nutrition\n🧠 Metabolic & inflammatory health\n\nThis is not about fear — it’s about awareness, context, and choosing what works best for your body.\n\n🎙️ Speaker: Dave Asprey\n🎧 Credit: The Skinny Confidential\n\n⚠️ Educational content only.

              "text": "That's actually false sugar, is not mint?For us at all, sugar was only meant to do one thing.For us, and one thing, only that is prepare us for wintertime. So when summer was over and us cave dwellers back then, we're roaming around our bodies would know wintertime is coming due to the fact of lack of vitamin d.So lack of sunlight being that when summer's over and daylight gets lesser, it automatically triggers our body to crave sweets, so back then, cavemen would eat fruits. They would eat fruits and the body would do with the body does, which is convert the natural sugar into good body fat that body fat would keep them backed in warm and also due to the fact of harsh winters, they could not go out to hunt. So therefore they didn't eat for months, but they did able to survive off of the body fat that they build up to prepare for winter. The problem with today is all the sugars and everything we eat. The carbs that all gets converted over into bad body fat bad cholesterol long-term it ends up causing dementia heart disease\nHigh blood pressure and also ends up, causing in the long run type 2 diabetes. Studies already have proven. We are not meant to spike insulin levels. Every day all day, it actually causes harm to our organs. This is why, when you hit at the age of 50 and 60 years old. And you're constantly with spiking sugar, as a child all the way up to that age, the body pretty much says enough is enough and literally gives up and seems stops producing insulin, which makes you type 2 diabetic. If you even live that long. Because heart disease will end up happening way before type 2 diabetes. Don't listen to these people. The problem also with insulin is it causes your red blood cells to only live for a maximum of 20 days where people don't realize is your red blood cells is actually what holds the aging process. Studies have already been proven off of carnivore diet me, one person that was on the carnivore diet for about 20 years, had blood work done. Blood work revealed his red blood cells were a 120 years old. They also realized that it ended up holding the aging process in the body. We can actually live a lot longer if we stop eating all these sugary foods that were not meant to eat. We're not supposed to eat carbohydrates. The reason why the body converts carbs to sugars is because it considers it a toxin same thing with vegetables vegetables. If you remember in biology class, plant baits, vegetables or plant-based anything. One thing they have a defense mechanism. They will secrete enzymes to warn away prey from eating them. What happens when you do them harvest your crops? You excrete those enzymes. What happens when you chop them up at home? You excrete those enzymes when you boil them, you excrete those enzymes. The funny thing is what people don't realize too is when you boil vegetables, you actually kill off all the vitamins and minerals, along with it. That enzyme, it excretes actually halts the body from absorbing any vitamins and nutrients that that vegetable would have. So therefore, you eating vegetables is pointless. Your body will probably only intake, maybe 2% of that. If anything, this is the reason why vegans have to take a massive amount of pills in the morning because they don't get all the vitamins and minerals from vegetables. Due to this toxic enzyme in vegetables\n\n I, stated this, plenty of research already on this the. Problem is doctors and everyone else won't bother with the research because it's not done by big pharma big\n\n Pharma is the only one who does all the research and you find that kind of funny, because they're the ones that issue all the pills they make the cancer pills they make the diabetic shot.\nUs from being on what they sell",

From Ancient Egypt to modern science, vinegar has been used to help regulate blood sugar, glucose spikes, and insulin response. Even thousands of years ago, Egyptians made vinegar-based drinks for people with diabetes.\n\nIn this short, we explore how a simple vinegar habit before meals can help flatten glucose spikes, improve metabolic health, and support better energy levels — backed by modern research and historical evidence.\n\n📉 Lower glucose spikes\n🍎 Eat the same foods\n🧪 Simple, science-backed habit\n🏺 Used since Ancient Egypt\n\n🎙️ Speaker: Jessie Inchauspé\n🎧 Credit: Tom Bilyeu (Impact Theory)\n\n⚠️ This content is for educational purposes only and does not replace medical advice.\n\n🔍 Hashtags \n\n#GlucoseSpikes #BloodSugar #Vinegar #AppleCiderVinegar\n#MetabolicHealth #InsulinResistance #DiabetesAwareness\n#AncientWisdom #AncientEgypt #HealthHack\n#NutritionShorts #Biohacking #HealthTips\n#JessieInchauspe #GlucoseGoddess #TomBilyeu\n#ImpactTheory #Wellness #Shorts #YTShorts",

They assigned me to a new provider.  Like to check out my providers on the internet.  She went to school in Oregon and had been practicing locally about ten years.  Couldn’t find much else about her.  Appointment time, she walks in in full Hijab.  No problem, we are going to talk about my health not religion or politics.  She started reading through my medical records.  Ask why my PCP hasn’t done any lab tests in two years.  Then sends a note out to my PCP.  Talks about the treatment from my pulmonologist.  Asked about my diet, carnivore, no disagreement.  She read through everything not just my cancer.  She answered all my questions before I got around to asking.  Very thorough.  The appointment lasted 45 minutes.  There are some good medical providers.",

Ruminant Organs (this is where people forget)\nIf ancient Yisrael did anything right nutritionally, it was nose-to-tail.\nLiver (beef or lamb)\n• ~0.1–0.2 mg B1 per 100 g\n• Also supplies magnesium and other B vitamins that work with thiamine\nHeart\n• Comparable or slightly higher B1 than liver\nKidney\n• Often overlooked, but legit source\n👉 Even 1–2 small servings per week materially improves thiamine status.\n3. Fish with Scales and Fins (Leviticus 11–clean)\nThis is a big one people ignore.\nTuna\nSalmon\nMackerel\nSardines\nThiamine content varies, but:\n~0.05–0.1 mg B1 per 100 g\nSardines punch above their weight nutritionally\n⚠️ One note of precision: raw fish contains thiaminase, which destroys B1.\n➡️ Cooking deactivates thiaminase, so cooked fish = no problem.\n4. Eggs (supportive, not primary)\nEggs won’t carry the whole load, but they contribute.\n~0.03 mg B1 per large egg\nAlso supply sulfur, choline, and B2, which support energy metabolism\nThink of eggs as backup singers, not the lead guitar.\n5. Dairy (if tolerated)\nNot huge, but not zero.\nRaw or full-fat milk\nHard cheeses\nLow thiamine density, but:\nAdds calories without carb load\nSupports overall B-vitamin balance\nWhy pork looks “special” (but isn’t necessary)\nPork is high in thiamine per gram, yes. That’s why Berry harps on it.\nBut here’s the part people gloss over:\nThiamine deficiency risk skyrockets with high carbohydrate intake\nOn low-carb / carnivore, B1 requirements drop\nRuminant meat + organs + fish easily cover needs\nAncient Yisrael didn’t need pigs to function. Neither do you.\n\n Beef (especially fatty ground)\n Ruminant organs\n Clean fish (cooked)\n Eggs\n Optional dairy\nAll Leviticus 11–compliant. All carnivore-compatible. All sufficient for vitamin B1.",

I fell off my diet, and when I was on it, I was OMAD, but I'd start my day with coffee, and I do the keto coffee thing with either half & half or full-fat whipping cream & coconut oil. Even though I didn't eat till 1 or 2 pm. So,  knowing about how coffee can affect things w/o a meal before hand, I'm guessing doing keto coffee doesn't get your body ready enough, but might work after lunch. I can probably deal with just water in the morning when I get back on my diet. I may, still I get myself fullly back on the carnivore diet, eat 2 meals a day. one being breakfast, and make that buttery eggs, then have my coffee. Then have my bigger meal at lunchtime, so I'm still doing intermittant fasting in a short window of time for the eating part of that. All that said, I may just have to lay off the coffee for a while till I get that fat burned off.",

On every holiday, I eat whatever is prepared. The next day is actually a fast day, because I normally have diarrhea the next day; as if my body is getting rid of something it knows is harmful. The next day, I go seamlessly back to Carnivore. Has never caused a problem, awakened my needs for sweets or carbs, or made me want to eat badly again. If anything, the one day change strengthens my resolve and belief in how I eat.",

Listening to you walk through everything made the last 11 months on carnivore flash right by for me. My daughter is actually the one who got me into carnivore. She started with you in 2020, she was one of your first members. Then tried out a lot of the other big carnivore spaces, and she’s already planning to come back to you in 2025 because nothing beats the original. You saved her from anorexia, and I won't be able to ever repay you for that. Appreciate everything you do.",

Now I’m at my goal weight, and actually working to put in lean muscle mass, and have added Pecorino and Parmigiana (Raw Aged Cheese) and I’m gaining lean mass nicely. Losing weight however required OMAD, and regular 36-72 hour fasts. Also did a 7 day and lost seven pounds of fat. The results, lost 75lbs, now 15%BF, and completely cleared my plaque psoriasis and Crones. I’m Carnivore for life.",

I can’t tell you how humbling that is and how much better it’s made our lives, much more so than just what concerns nutrition. Our relationship is even better, to be honest with you! Thanks for showing us that old dogs CAN learn new tricks. Hats off to you, love from ATX and see you all soon.",

Don't buy what you KNOW you're not supposed to be eating, thinking that you're going to be able to regulate and have \"only a little bit\", it's NEVER going to work!! Just don't buy that junk, and trust me, you're not going to die, and soon you'll realize how easy it is to stick to your diet once a week or two pass without putting those things in your body. I've been very strict for 2 weeks and I'm already free and don't feel that I'm missing out on anything, like I used to in the past. Try it. It works!!!",

The hardest thing for me is the stress and anxiety that comes from being married to an insecure and attention hound narcissistic husband who doesnt listen to me about anything and refuses and defies any change that takes commitment and fortitude. He adores the taste of processed food, I dont serve it, im a gourmet cook, but he sneeks it and therefore often feels lousy, crabby, and lazy. Uncommitted to healthy routines and in constant need for validation. I had let myself go and gained 100 pounds turning to food and wine for relief but ive lost 50 pounds, avoided colon surgery, and feel better then I have in twenty years. Therapist thinks I should take some kind of pharmaceutical for my anxiety but I dont believe in that, so carnivore and b1, b12, and minerals (saltt) has helped me alot!!  I guess what im getting at is, suggestions for a nervous person who's trying to stick to her own commitment to health and LIVING? Who lives with a person who tries to pull her down.",

I’m not out buying chips or actual sugar and bread etc sometimes to stay sane we have to enjoy the things that make us feel joy instead of going extreme off kilter and giving us guilt over it. Dr berry once said if you’re gonna cheat on carnivore cheat with keto and truer words have never been spoken haha",

I had a lot of histamine issues too. But every time I tried to introduce fruit or veggies, after a few days I would have digestive issues among other things. I found the Gaps diet and bought the book and watched countless videos on Youtube and decided to give it a try. It has been nothing short of miraculous. Now to be honest the path is NOT easy but it is worth it. Just a note: Gaps diet is not intended to be long term. It is only to heal the body and build the microbiome. There have been autistic nonverbal children who after doing Gaps can speak in complete sentences. Praise God!",

I can confirm that they are soooo horrible I had to eat them all myself so that no one else had to suffer through them. 😉\nMine didn't turn out quite as pretty as yours cuz I had a problem flipping one of them and it broke in half, but still tasted good. I think next time, for me, I will make 6 smaller ones cuz with my Neuropathy... my pancake flipping skills are not exactly prime level. LoL!\nStill getting settled from my move December 1st, with the holidays in there it is taking a little longer than I like. But, I have ur cookbook, and am slowly getting settled so that I can try even more of your recipes, Ya know... cuz they are sooooo horrible. Gee, maybe I should go back to eating \"healthy\" Doritos and Oreos!\nHope your having a wonderful holiday season and getting all ur last minute stuff ready for Van Life.",

              "text": "Main reasons imo why they fail is… (btw saying this as 1 year strict carnivore, 1.5 normal carnivore (including dairy) and 3 years raw primal/raw carnivore prior to starting carnivore so not inexperienced in carnivore lifestyle) \n\n- Convenience (financial convenience, sourcing convenience eg. Fats, bone marrow, organs, grass fed/grass finished, social convenience, regional convenience eg. Going on holiday to a resort where meals are prepaid for and you can’t be completely carnivore. \n\n- Adaptation struggles in early phases. Stool movement problems, (Possibly Bile Acid Malabsorption, or most commonly not eating enough fat causing constipation.) heart palpitation from an energy prioritisation change (hearing beat in ear when sleeping, this passes after some time but the more you cheat and mess with carbs, the longer the process), possible tiredness from not utilising fat for energy as well in initial phases which gets better but don’t stop training (whether on carb or fat diet, people who train will know that when you stop, your endurance ends up dropping and so does strength. Understanding exercise timing is important. The meals in carnivore diets a larger and longer to digest meals usually so exercise feels best imo either in the morning before eating large meals or 5-6 hours after a large meal. It’s not that you won’t have energy but your body will be taxed more when trying to process a large meal and also being put through physically straining exercise at the same time . Little pro tip though, if you insist on eating before workout, eggs digest really fast compared to other carnivore foods. 27 mins for eggs to digest. I personally don’t really do little snack meals on carnivore usually but if you feel really hungry and sluggish to workout perhaps due to not fully adapting or maybe due to the last meal before being too long ago, eggs are amazing because they digest faster and satiating. \nMineral/vitamin imbalances perhaps but I never had this for any other than vitamin D for which I was just told to take tablets for a bit then make sure once I get through the tablets to get enough sunlight. as someone who has bloodworks done like once a year, I didn’t have any other deficiencies in vitamins/minerals. \n\n- Locking yourself in mid dke of animal base/carnivore and constantly going in and out of keto so not feeling as good. \n\n-Overloading on caffeine. Yes you’re not having sugar and it’s still keto but it’s still not ideal and using coffee as a way of weight loss and ensuring stool movement is not the ideal way to do carnivore. In my opinion, it’s not even carnivore but it’s still animal based ketovore so still really good but if you overdo it, then you end up taking over certain stuff that switching to carnivore/keto should do anyway. And coffee still has oxalates so on a diet trying to lower antinutrients, drinking coffee isn’t ideal and I understand some people love their morning coffee but they’re not giving themselves the chance to experience how great it feels to be in ketosis and not need coffee to wake them up. And also, drinking coffee makes you not get hungry but you already shouldn’t be getting hungry anyway if you eat until you’re full on carnivore on fat and meat meals. You may not eat enough due to this and then yes you will lose weight but you’ll lose it in a nutritionally deficient way, so not in a healthy manner. If you wanna lose weight and your eating as much as you want before full is too much for weight loss goals, then you can do so with different ratios of fat/protein. Increasing the fat ratio works for some because it’s calorically higher yes but practically it’s also more satiating and usually people can’t eat as much after. Plus adjusting training to match weight loss goals can help since weight isn’t just dietary. You can also implement raw meat/fat. I’ve found that eating raw meat of same volume can keep me satiated for longer than cooked meat. However, with raw fat, although I feel more satiated, I can also eat way more raw fat in a sitting than cooked fat so that may change based on the person. \nThere’s also different outcomes based on high meat but a carnivore beginner probably won’t need to concern themselves with high meat lol. \n\nI could probably come up with more but Im tired of writing.",
