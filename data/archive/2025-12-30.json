    "weekly_summary": "This week's carnivore content reveals a significant split in the data collection - the top channel 'The Plant Slant' (1.1M views) is actually a plant-based/anti-carnivore creator, creating confusion in the dataset. Among actual carnivore creators, the focus is heavily on New Year preparation and beginner guidance, with both Dr. Anthony Chaffee and Steak and Butter Gal releasing 'If I Started Carnivore in 2026' content. The community shows strong engagement around practical concerns: nutrient completeness (especially B vitamins), oxalate dumping symptoms, travel logistics, and recipe innovations for those seeking variety while staying carnivore.\n\nA notable trend is the emphasis on troubleshooting common failures - Max German's video on mistakes and Courtney Luna's discussion of weight loss stalls generated significant discussion. The community continues to share dramatic health transformations, particularly from former vegetarians/vegans, with multiple testimonials about reversing MS symptoms, IBS, and other chronic conditions. Recipe content remains popular, especially carnivore versions of comfort foods (pancakes, ice cream, kebabs) as creators help followers maintain the diet long-term through the holiday season and into 2026 resolutions.",

        "answer": "Hey there! I totally get how frustrating weight loss plateaus can feel. When it comes to the carnivore diet and weight loss, the science gets pretty nuanced. Research suggests that simply eliminating carbs doesn't guarantee weight loss - calorie balance is still king. My Oura ring data and blood glucose tracking have shown me how individual metabolic responses can be.\n\n    A 2020 study in Nutrients highlighted that while high-protein, low-carb diets can trigger metabolic advantages, total caloric intake matters most. If you're consuming more calories from meat than you're burning, weight loss stalls. Factors like insulin sensitivity, stress levels (tracked beautifully on my WHOOP), sleep quality, and individual metabolic differences play huge roles.\n\n    For sustainable weight transformation, I recommend tracking not just calories but macronutrient ratios, stress markers, and recovery metrics. Consider working with a metabolic specialist who can do detailed blood panel analysis to understand your unique biochemistry. Your body is telling a complex story - we just need to listen carefully.",

        "answer": "Hey there! When it comes to a beef-only carnivore diet and nutritional completeness, the science gets pretty nuanced. Research suggests beef is an incredibly nutrient-dense food, especially for B vitamins like B12, but total nutritional completeness is more complicated.\n\nBeef provides exceptional levels of bioavailable vitamin B12, zinc, and high-quality protein. A 2022 nutrition review in the Journal of Nutritional Science showed grass-fed beef contains significantly higher micronutrient density compared to grain-fed varieties. However, a pure beef-only approach might create potential deficiencies in vitamin C, folate, and certain trace minerals that typically come from plant sources.\n\nMy recommendation? If you're exploring a carnivore approach, consider liver as a 'superfood' complement to muscle meat. Beef liver dramatically increases micronutrient profiles and provides a more comprehensive nutritional spectrum. I've seen clients using continuous glucose monitors (like my beloved Levels app) track incredible metabolic responses when integrating organ meats strategically.",

        "answer": "Hey there! When diving into significant dietary shifts like a carnivore approach, your body can definitely experience some interesting transitions. 'Oxalate dumping' is a fascinating phenomenon where individuals switching to high-protein, low-oxalate diets might experience temporary symptoms like skin irritation, fatigue, or mild digestive changes.\n\nResearch suggests this isn't a formally recognized medical condition, but a reported experience among people radically changing their nutritional intake. From my tracking with continuous glucose monitors and blood panels, I've seen fascinating metabolic adaptations during dietary transitions. Symptoms can include temporary inflammation, potential mineral rebalancing, and your body's metabolic 'recalibration.'\n\nThe key is gentle, mindful transitions. I always recommend tracking your biomarkers through tools like HealthKit or Oura Ring to understand your individual response. Blood tests tracking inflammation markers, kidney function, and nutrient levels can provide incredible insights into how your body is adapting.",

        "question": "How do I travel while maintaining carnivore diet?",
        "answer": "Okay, carnivore travelers - let's get real about keeping your protein game strong while globetrotting! 🍖✈️ First pro tip: Always pack portable protein sources like beef jerky, canned fish, and protein powder. Research shows maintaining protein intake during travel helps preserve muscle mass and metabolic flexibility.\n\nThe key strategy is planning ahead. Many airport lounges and international restaurants now offer protein-friendly options like grilled meats, eggs, and seafood. Pro YouTubers like Mike Mutzel and Paul Saladino have totally cracked the code on traveling carnivore. I've seen their travel meal prep videos, and they're legit game-changers.\n\nQuick hack: Use apps like Google Maps and Happy Cow to scout protein-friendly restaurants in advance. Some travelers even pre-pack a small travel cooler with vacuum-sealed meats. Just check international customs regulations first - you don't want your premium grass-fed ribeye getting confiscated! 😂",

        "question": "Should I include organs/pork/dairy or stick to beef only?",
        "answer": "Hey there! I totally get why you're exploring the carnivore diet's nuances. From my research tracking metabolic markers and protein intake, diversifying animal protein sources can actually optimize your nutritional profile.\n\nBeef is phenomenal, but organs like liver provide critical micronutrients that muscle meat alone can't deliver. Specifically, beef liver is a nutritional powerhouse with vitamin A, B12, and iron in highly bioavailable forms. Regarding dairy and pork, individual metabolic responses vary. My recommendation? Start with grass-fed beef, slowly introduce organ meats like liver and heart, and track your blood glucose and energy markers using tools like Oura Ring or continuous glucose monitors.\n\nResearch suggests that nutrient density matters more than strict protein source limitations. The key is quality, sourcing, and how YOUR unique body responds. Blood work and subjective energy tracking will be your best indicators of dietary success.",

        "question": "How long does the adaptation period take before feeling benefits?",
        "answer": "Hey there! When diving into the carnivore diet adaptation, most individuals report significant metabolic shifts between 4-12 weeks. Research suggests the body requires substantial time to fully transition metabolic pathways from glucose to primarily fat and protein metabolism.\n\nMy clients using continuous glucose monitors (like the ones I track with Levels and Oura) typically see metabolic stabilization around 6-8 weeks. During this period, you might experience temporary fatigue, electrolyte fluctuations, and potential digestive recalibration. Your body is essentially rewiring its energy extraction mechanisms from carbohydrate-dependent to protein and fat-driven systems.\n\nInterestingly, individual adaptation varies dramatically based on prior metabolic flexibility, current health status, and genetic factors. I always recommend tracking key biomarkers like fasting insulin, inflammation markers (hsCRP), and comprehensive metabolic panels to understand your unique physiological response.",

        "question": "Is counting calories necessary on carnivore or just eat to satiety?",
        "answer": "Hey there! I know navigating nutritional approaches can feel overwhelming, especially with something as focused as the carnivore diet. Current research suggests that for most people on a carnivore diet, eating to satiety might actually be more effective than strict calorie counting.\n\nA fascinating study from 2020 in the Journal of Clinical Medicine found that high-protein, low-carb diets naturally regulate hunger hormones like leptin and ghrelin. This means your body's innate signals might do a better job of managing intake than manually tracking every calorie. My Whoop and Oura data tracking with clients shows fascinating metabolic responses - many report spontaneous calorie reduction when protein intake is high and consistent.\n\nHowever, individual metabolic variability is real. While some thrive on pure satiety signaling, others might need more precise tracking. I recommend starting with intuitive eating and tracking key biomarkers like blood glucose, weight, and energy levels. Your body is an incredible feedback system if you learn to listen.",

Pro tip: Don't turn dinner into a battleground. Instead, focus on preparing shared meals where you can customize your protein portions. YouTube creators like Dr. Ken Berry have amazing content about making mixed dietary households work smoothly.\n\nNutritional science suggests gradual transitions work best. Consider introducing your family to some carnivore-adjacent recipes that everyone might enjoy. Think high-protein meals with flexible sides. The key is making your dietary choice feel collaborative, not confrontational.",

For those who are thinking of trying that with this or any other recipe, do it first with a small batch and lay them out in a single layer on something easy to take in and out of the freezer. Getting the surface of them frozen makes them less likely to stick together once they are in a container. Worst case scenario is that the recipe does not lend itself well to freezing and the patties crumble. you can than use those crumbly bits as a browned ground meat substitute in a lot of other dishes so nothing goes to waste.",

              "text": "Meat is digested in the stomach with strong acid, while plants are fermented in the gut.\n\nIf you only eat plants, you don’t need high stomach acid, so your body stops making it. This becomes a problem if you start eating meat again because you won’t have enough acid to digest it. The fix is to gradually increase meat consumption so your stomach acid production ramps up again.\n\nYou also need bile to digest animal fats. If you’re not eating fat, your bile flow slows, bile thickens into sludge and gallstones can form. When you suddenly reintroduce fat, you may not digest it well because your bile ducts can be blocked. To get bile flowing again, bile salts and gradually increasing animal fat can help.\n\nBile is released from the gallbladder when you eat fat and it’s not just for fat digestion. Bile salts also act as a natural intestinal lubricant and mild laxative, keeping stool soft and triggering the muscular contractions that move waste along. Low bile output makes stool drier, harder and slower to pass.\n\nIf you’re sensitive to histamine, source non-hung/aged meat straight from a slaughterhouse.\n\nA plant-based, low-animal-fat diet is not good for long-term health, despite what’s promoted. Humans are designed to eat meat and animal fats.  Things start breaking down when we don’t.",

And because not only I loved animals and tried to be as kind to the environment as I could be, I was also health conscious, so I ate whole foods and when possible organic. Ok, occassionly I ate bad stuff, like I had a sweet tooth, but I ate clean during the week, and allowed myself treats on the weekend, one day or sometimes two. I ended up insulin resistant and with SIBO, and lost heaps of muscle.\nNow 3 months carnivore, I have flat stomach, muscle hasnt increased yet, but I guess I just cant eat enough yet. But overall, my energy levels are awesome, no after meal dips, I sleep heaps better and just in general feel tons better. I want my muscles back, and continue on this healing journey because it is awesome how I feek",

I've noted post nasal drip comes when I drink it and not when I don't. \nSo yeah am I pro Carni... absolutely. Why ? Cause I got my life back and never had even a sniffle of sickness ever since. I don't sunburn, I don't sweat like a fermenting pig, I don't have brain fog, I don't have a bad attitude anymore.

About two months ago I switched to the air fryer. I put the steak in the air fryer, put some bacon drippings over the top of each steak (luckily my local butcher makes his own bacon and sells the bacon drippings), salt on top and then cook it to my liking. It goes on the plate and then I pour the dripping from the air fryer over the top on my meat like a sauce and it is delicious. Easy clean up and no messy stove.

              "text": "6 years carnivore December 12th 2025. What i wish i knew when i started was how important salt is on a low carb/zero carb/carnivore lifestyle. And i started because i felt like my lifelong epilepsy was killing me slowly. Nothing was working, and after seeing a dr and her telling me i needed antidepressants, i realised i wasn't going to get any help from my dr and i'd have to figure my health out for myself. After some research i came upon carnivore and it changed my life. I came from a standard western diet (uk) from childhood to teen, then to a bodybuilders diet through my mid 20s to thirties - which i would call plant based and low fat - and is where i felt my absolute worst, and then carnivore from age 40. I'm 46 now. And like i said earlier. Carnivore changed my life!!\nBut i didn't know that salt would be so important and possibly the reason why i developed epilepsy in the first place. My mum told me she never used salt in her cooking - and still doesn't (and she's always suffering something🤦🏾‍♀️) i had absences when i was a child and full blown seizures after i started my periods. When i think back to my past, i don't remember much because i was always sick. I never felt well within myself. And so when i dig deeper into this carnivore diet, different branches of information lead back to how i felt as a youngster and lightbulbs are going off!! Could a lack of salt have caused this? Why do i have seizures on my period mostly, and why does salt always make me feel better straight away? I never added it all together until nearly 6 years in because i thought stopping the seizures was all about the fat - and it wasn't! At least for me! High fat carnivore drastically reduced the seizures to almost nothing but adding/supplementing salt - was the cherry on top! The bow that tied it all together! This has blown my mind! And salt isn't just important for me and my epilepsy, its important for human health overall and i believe everybody should be using it daily. Dr Chaffee... i tell ya, if i knew this when i started... life changing. Meat, fat and plenty of salt guys. This is all we need.",

Really concerning at the time and I couldn't find any information about it. Eventually it just disappeared.\nAfter hearing you mention this, I searched again and it's well-documented now. It's caused by excess protein breakdown during adaptation. Your body produces ammonia as a byproduct, and during transition it gets released through sweat and breath.\nGood news: it's temporary and normal. Typically resolves within weeks to months once you're fat-adapted.\nIf anyone else is experiencing this, don't panic. Stay hydrated, keep electrolytes balanced (especially potassium), and eat enough fat relative to protein. Your body is just adapting.\nHope this helps someone going through it right now.",

              "text": "That's actually false sugar, is not mint?For us at all, sugar was only meant to do one thing.For us, and one thing, only that is prepare us for wintertime. So when summer was over and us cave dwellers back then, we're roaming around our bodies would know wintertime is coming due to the fact of lack of vitamin d.So lack of sunlight being that when summer's over and daylight gets lesser, it automatically triggers our body to crave sweets, so back then, cavemen would eat fruits. They would eat fruits and the body would do with the body does, which is convert the natural sugar into good body fat that body fat would keep them backed in warm and also due to the fact of harsh winters, they could not go out to hunt. So therefore they didn't eat for months, but they did able to survive off of the body fat that they build up to prepare for winter. The problem with today is all the sugars and everything we eat. The carbs that all gets converted over into bad body fat bad cholesterol long-term it ends up causing dementia heart disease\nHigh blood pressure and also ends up, causing in the long run type 2 diabetes. Studies already have proven. We are not meant to spike insulin levels. Every day all day, it actually causes harm to our organs. This is why, when you hit at the age of 50 and 60 years old. And you're constantly with spiking sugar, as a child all the way up to that age, the body pretty much says enough is enough and literally gives up and seems stops producing insulin, which makes you type 2 diabetic. If you even live that long. Because heart disease will end up happening way before type 2 diabetes. Don't listen to these people. The problem also with insulin is it causes your red blood cells to only live for a maximum of 20 days where people don't realize is your red blood cells is actually what holds the aging process. Studies have already been proven off of carnivore diet me, one person that was on the carnivore diet for about 20 years, had blood work done. Blood work revealed his red blood cells were a 120 years old. They also realized that it ended up holding the aging process in the body. We can actually live a lot longer if we stop eating all these sugary foods that were not meant to eat. We're not supposed to eat carbohydrates. The reason why the body converts carbs to sugars is because it considers it a toxin same thing with vegetables vegetables. If you remember in biology class, plant baits, vegetables or plant-based anything. One thing they have a defense mechanism. They will secrete enzymes to warn away prey from eating them. What happens when you do them harvest your crops? You excrete those enzymes. What happens when you chop them up at home? You excrete those enzymes when you boil them, you excrete those enzymes. The funny thing is what people don't realize too is when you boil vegetables, you actually kill off all the vitamins and minerals, along with it. That enzyme, it excretes actually halts the body from absorbing any vitamins and nutrients that that vegetable would have. So therefore, you eating vegetables is pointless. Your body will probably only intake, maybe 2% of that. If anything, this is the reason why vegans have to take a massive amount of pills in the morning because they don't get all the vitamins and minerals from vegetables. Due to this toxic enzyme in vegetables\n\n I, stated this, plenty of research already on this the. Problem is doctors and everyone else won't bother with the research because it's not done by big pharma big\n\n Pharma is the only one who does all the research and you find that kind of funny, because they're the ones that issue all the pills they make the cancer pills they make the diabetic shot.\nUs from being on what they sell",

The next day, I go seamlessly back to Carnivore. Has never caused a problem, awakened my needs for sweets or carbs, or made me want to eat badly again. If anything, the one day change strengthens my resolve and belief in how I eat.",

She started with you in 2020, she was one of your first members. Then tried out a lot of the other big carnivore spaces, and she’s already planning to come back to you in 2025 because nothing beats the original. You saved her from anorexia, and I won't be able to ever repay you for that. Appreciate everything you do.",

Now I’m at my goal weight, and actually working to put in lean muscle mass, and have added Pecorino and Parmigiana (Raw Aged Cheese) and I’m gaining lean mass nicely. Losing weight however required OMAD, and regular 36-72 hour fasts. Also did a 7 day and lost seven pounds of fat. The results, lost 75lbs, now 15%BF, and completely cleared my plaque psoriasis and Crones. I’m Carnivore for life.",

I can’t tell you how humbling that is and how much better it’s made our lives, much more so than just what concerns nutrition. Our relationship is even better, to be honest with you!

I've been very strict for 2 weeks and I'm already free and don't feel that I'm missing out on anything, like I used to in the past. Try it. It works!!!",

They assigned me to a new provider.  Like to check out my providers on the internet.  She went to school in Oregon and had been practicing locally about ten years.  Couldn’t find much else about her.  Appointment time, she walks in in full Hijab.  No problem, we are going to talk about my health not religion or politics.  She started reading through my medical records.  Ask why my PCP hasn’t done any lab tests in two years.  Then sends a note out to my PCP.  Talks about the treatment from my pulmonologist.  Asked about my diet, carnivore, no disagreement.  She read through everything not just my cancer.  She answered all my questions before I got around to asking.  Very thorough.  The appointment lasted 45 minutes.  There are some good medical providers.",

Ruminant Organs (this is where people forget)\nIf ancient Yisrael did anything right nutritionally, it was nose-to-tail.\nLiver (beef or lamb)\n• ~0.1–0.2 mg B1 per 100 g\n• Also supplies magnesium and other B vitamins that work with thiamine\nHeart\n• Comparable or slightly higher B1 than liver\nKidney\n• Often overlooked, but legit source\n👉 Even 1–2 small servings per week materially improves thiamine status.\n3. Fish with Scales and Fins (Leviticus 11–clean)\nThis is a big one people ignore.\nTuna\nSalmon\nMackerel\nSardines\nThiamine content varies, but:\n~0.05–0.1 mg B1 per 100 g\nSardines punch above their weight nutritionally\n⚠️ One note of precision: raw fish contains thiaminase, which destroys B1.\n➡️ Cooking deactivates thiaminase, so cooked fish = no problem.\n4. Eggs (supportive, not primary)\nEggs won’t carry the whole load, but they contribute.\n~0.03 mg B1 per large egg\nAlso supply sulfur, choline, and B2, which support energy metabolism\nThink of eggs as backup singers, not the lead guitar.\n5. Dairy (if tolerated)\nNot huge, but not zero.\nRaw or full-fat milk\nHard cheeses\nLow thiamine density, but:\nAdds calories without carb load\nSupports overall B-vitamin balance\nWhy pork looks “special” (but isn’t necessary)\nPork is high in thiamine per gram, yes. That’s why Berry harps on it.\nBut here’s the part people gloss over:\nThiamine deficiency risk skyrockets with high carbohydrate intake\nOn low-carb / carnivore, B1 requirements drop\nRuminant meat + organs + fish easily cover needs\nAncient Yisrael didn’t need pigs to function. Neither do you.\n\n Beef (especially fatty ground)\n Ruminant organs\n Clean fish (cooked)\n Eggs\n Optional dairy\nAll Leviticus 11–compliant. All carnivore-compatible. All sufficient for vitamin B1.",

I think next time, for me, I will make 6 smaller ones cuz with my Neuropathy... my pancake flipping skills are not exactly prime level. LoL!\nStill getting settled from my move December 1st, with the holidays in there it is taking a little longer than I like. But, I have ur cookbook, and am slowly getting settled so that I can try even more of your recipes, Ya know... cuz they are sooooo horrible. Gee, maybe I should go back to eating \"healthy\" Doritos and Oreos!\nHope your having a wonderful holiday season and getting all ur last minute stuff ready for Van Life.",

Unfortunately I did put on fat especially in my belly which now I look like I did prior to carnivore when I was bloated all the time and the scale is definitely up. The frustrating thing is I can't get the scale to budge down now even though I've cut back on the fat. Ugh.",

And recently, 3 day fasting mimicking sardine fast - that’s 1 can sardine per 50lbs body weight & 2.5 for me, a day and NOT the all you can eat sardine regimen - followed by 3 day DRY fast. Awesome plus healing a difficult tendonopathy, like nothing else. The actual real fast is way easy even on first day after the ketogenic set up of the sardine fast mimicking days.\n\nLuckily for me, I have a European palette so sardines, funky salty fishy foods, liver, organs, collagenous chewy parts of animal, raw meat, raw eggs - all are delicious to me. I also ferment local, seasonal fruit often home-grown, and eat little bits, mostly drinking the ferment water. As well as fermenting raw milk kefir.\n\nIm post-meno so fasting is not a hindrance of anything for me. I get bloaty and farty on water fasting and anything, even after almost 3 years carnivore. Been fasting and IF a long time. Thyroid fine. Hair thick and fast growing. Sleep great. Emergy great. (Getting ahead of the carb freaks. 😂) EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT. As a 5 foot tall muscular busty woman, nobody else’s protocols work for me except my own, honed and experimented and re-honed as phases shift. I can eat as much as a 200lb dude, so my journey is learning how to eat like a bird. Cheers!",

That's the commitment you have got to do. Label reading and deciding. It's not easy, but it's the right thing and the right thing isn't always easy, but it's always right.",

The second is to move, preferably resistance training and sprints, but whatever it is make sure you enjoy it. The third is to understand that this lifestyle is for a lifetime. You do these three things, then everything else seems to fall in place.",

              "text": "Main reasons imo why they fail is… (btw saying this as 1 year strict carnivore, 1.5 normal carnivore (including dairy) and 3 years raw primal/raw carnivore prior to starting carnivore so not inexperienced in carnivore lifestyle) \n\n- Convenience (financial convenience, sourcing convenience eg. Fats, bone marrow, organs, grass fed/grass finished, social convenience, regional convenience eg. Going on holiday to a resort where meals are prepaid for and you can’t be completely carnivore. \n\n- Adaptation struggles in early phases. Stool movement problems, (Possibly Bile Acid Malabsorption, or most commonly not eating enough fat causing constipation.) heart palpitation from an energy prioritisation change (hearing beat in ear when sleeping, this passes after some time but the more you cheat and mess with carbs, the longer the process), possible tiredness from not utilising fat for energy as well in initial phases which gets better but don’t stop training (whether on carb or fat diet, people who train will know that when you stop, your endurance ends up dropping and so does strength. Understanding exercise timing is important. The meals in carnivore diets a larger and longer to digest meals usually so exercise feels best imo either in the morning before eating large meals or 5-6 hours after a large meal. It’s not that you won’t have energy but your body will be taxed more when trying to process a large meal and also being put through physically straining exercise at the same time . Little pro tip though, if you insist on eating before workout, eggs digest really fast compared to other carnivore foods. 27 mins for eggs to digest. I personally don’t really do little snack meals on carnivore usually but if you feel really hungry and sluggish to workout perhaps due to not fully adapting or maybe due to the last meal before being too long ago, eggs are amazing because they digest faster and satiating. \nMineral/vitamin imbalances perhaps but I never had this for any other than vitamin D for which I was just told to take tablets for a bit then make sure once I get through the tablets to get enough sunlight. as someone who has bloodworks done like once a year, I didn’t have any other deficiencies in vitamins/minerals. \n\n- Locking yourself in mid dke of animal base/carnivore and constantly going in and out of keto so not feeling as good. \n\n-Overloading on caffeine. Yes you’re not having sugar and it’s still keto but it’s still not ideal and using coffee as a way of weight loss and ensuring stool movement is not the ideal way to do carnivore. In my opinion, it’s not even carnivore but it’s still animal based ketovore so still really good but if you overdo it, then you end up taking over certain stuff that switching to carnivore/keto should do anyway. And coffee still has oxalates so on a diet trying to lower antinutrients, drinking coffee isn’t ideal and I understand some people love their morning coffee but they’re not giving themselves the chance to experience how great it feels to be in ketosis and not need coffee to wake them up. And also, drinking coffee makes you not get hungry but you already shouldn’t be getting hungry anyway if you eat until you’re full on carnivore on fat and meat meals. You may not eat enough due to this and then yes you will lose weight but you’ll lose it in a nutritionally deficient way, so not in a healthy manner. If you wanna lose weight and your eating as much as you want before full is too much for weight loss goals, then you can do so with different ratios of fat/protein. Increasing the fat ratio works for some because it’s calorically higher yes but practically it’s also more satiating and usually people can’t eat as much after. Plus adjusting training to match weight loss goals can help since weight isn’t just dietary. You can also implement raw meat/fat. I’ve found that eating raw meat of same volume can keep me satiated for longer than cooked meat. However, with raw fat, although I feel more satiated, I can also eat way more raw fat in a sitting than cooked fat so that may change based on the person. \nThere’s also different outcomes based on high meat but a carnivore beginner probably won’t need to concern themselves with high meat lol. \n\nI could probably come up with more but Im tired of writing.",
