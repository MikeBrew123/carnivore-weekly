But this week, creators dug into the harder questions: why do people actually quit? Should you be strict or flexible? What works long-term?\n\nDairy sparked the biggest debate. Dr. Anthony Chaffee says eliminate it completely. Others argue it helps people stick to the diet. Meanwhile, gut health's everywhere right now—sauerkraut juice, bone broth, B1 deficiency—because the community's ready to optimize beyond just eating meat.\n\nOptimalHealth's video on India's diet hit 4.5M views, bringing carnivore ideas to mainstream audiences. Meanwhile, creators like Steak and Butter Gal and HomeSteadHow shared practical guides showing how to actually afford this lifestyle. People are asking real questions: How do I manage electrolytes? What about traveling? How do I keep this interesting?\n\nDr. Layne Norton threw some cold water on carnivore claims, defending fiber and challenging the metabolism story. That created friction—but it's the kind of tension that means the conversation's maturing.",

        "answer": "To make a carnivore diet more sustainable and cost-effective, focus on less expensive protein sources like organ meats, ground meats, chicken, and less premium beef cuts. Organ meats like liver, heart, and kidney are nutrient-dense, significantly cheaper, and provide essential micronutrients often lacking in muscle meats. Purchasing in bulk, utilizing cheaper cuts like chuck roast, ground beef, and chicken thighs, and buying from local farmers or wholesale suppliers can dramatically reduce costs.\n\nNutritional diversity is critical, even on a carnivore approach. Rotate between different animal protein sources to ensure a comprehensive micronutrient profile. Include fatty fish like sardines and mackerel for omega-3s, and consider organ meats like beef liver for vitamin A, B vitamins, and minerals. Frozen meats are often more affordable and retain nutritional value. Slow-cooking tougher, less expensive cuts can improve palatability and digestibility.",

        "question": "Should I eliminate dairy completely or keep it for adherence?",
        "answer": "From a nutritional science perspective, dairy can be strategically included in a carnivore diet with careful consideration. High-quality, full-fat dairy products like butter, heavy cream, and hard cheeses contain minimal lactose and can provide beneficial nutrients such as saturated fats, vitamin K2, and calcium without significant insulin response. Research suggests that for individuals without lactose intolerance or dairy allergies, selective dairy consumption may support metabolic flexibility and dietary adherence.\n\nHowever, individual tolerance varies significantly. Some carnivore diet practitioners report improved inflammatory markers and digestive health by eliminating dairy entirely, while others find modest dairy intake supports their metabolic goals. The key is personalized experimentation and monitoring biomarkers like inflammation indicators, body composition, and subjective well-being.",

        "question": "How much salt do I actually need on carnivore?",
        "answer": "On a carnivore diet, sodium requirements are higher than traditional dietary guidelines due to the elimination of carbohydrates, which impacts electrolyte balance. The recommended sodium intake for individuals on a strict carnivore diet is typically 3,000-5,000 mg per day, significantly higher than the standard 1,500-2,300 mg recommended for most populations. This increased need stems from the metabolic adaptations in ketogenic states where sodium excretion increases and insulin levels remain low.\n\nResearch suggests that individuals on very low-carbohydrate diets require additional sodium to maintain proper electrolyte balance, prevent 'keto flu' symptoms, and support kidney function. High-quality animal proteins naturally contain some sodium, but supplementation or intentional salt intake is often necessary to prevent potential deficiencies. The primary sources on a carnivore diet include sea salt, pink Himalayan salt, or added salt during meal preparation.",

        "question": "What supplements are truly necessary (especially B1)?",
        "answer": "On a strict carnivore diet, several critical nutritional supplements become essential due to the diet's restrictive nature. Vitamin B1 (thiamine) is particularly important, as red meat alone may not provide adequate levels, especially when consuming primarily muscle meat. A 2018 study by Woolf et al. highlighted that thiamine requirements increase with high protein intake, making supplementation crucial for preventing potential neurological complications.\n\nBeyond B1, key supplements typically recommended include vitamin D (due to lack of plant-based sources), magnesium (which can be depleted in ketogenic diets), and potentially a comprehensive B-complex vitamin to address potential micronutrient gaps. Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation is also advisable, as the carnivore diet's meat composition may lead to an imbalanced omega-3 to omega-6 ratio.\n\nIt's critical to note that while some individuals report short-term success with the carnivore diet, long-term nutritional adequacy remains a significant concern. Regular blood work and consultation with a healthcare professional who understands nutritional biochemistry are strongly recommended to monitor potential deficiencies.",

While animal-based diets can potentially reduce microbiome diversity, strategic supplementation and meat selection can mitigate potential negative impacts. Key strategies include consuming nose-to-tail animal products (which provide prebiotic-like compounds), incorporating organ meats rich in micronutrients, and potentially using targeted probiotic supplements.\n\nFor 'perfect poop', focus on high-quality animal proteins with adequate fat content, proper hydration, and potentially supplementing with electrolytes. Research suggests that well-formulated carnivore diets can maintain normal gastrointestinal transit time and stool consistency through easily digestible protein and fat sources.

        "answer": "When experiencing a plateau on the carnivore diet, several evidence-based strategies can help optimize metabolic outcomes. First, consider micronutrient variation by cycling different animal protein sources (beef, fish, poultry, organ meats) to ensure comprehensive nutrient intake and prevent potential micronutrient deficiencies. Some individuals may benefit from strategic reintroduction of minimal non-muscle meats like liver, which provides dense micronutrient profiles that could reset metabolic adaptation.\n\nMetabolic plateaus often require hormonal and metabolic recalibration. Consider implementing periodic caloric cycling, intermittent fasting protocols, or subtle macronutrient adjustments. Research suggests that metabolic flexibility can be enhanced through strategic nutritional interventions, potentially breaking stagnation by signaling metabolic reset mechanisms. Consulting with a functional medicine practitioner who understands carnivore/ketogenic metabolic principles can provide personalized biochemical insights.",

        "answer": "Navigating social situations, travel, and holidays on a carnivore diet requires strategic planning and flexibility. Preparation is key: consider bringing your own protein-rich foods to gatherings, researching restaurant menus in advance, and communicating dietary needs proactively. For travel, pack shelf-stable protein sources like jerky, canned fish, or vacuum-sealed meats, and identify restaurants or grocery stores that offer suitable options.\n\nPsychosocial research suggests that maintaining dietary adherence during social events can be challenging. While limited direct research exists on carnivore-specific social strategies, studies on ketogenic and low-carbohydrate diets indicate that having a clear personal rationale, social support, and practical coping mechanisms can significantly improve dietary compliance. Consider approaching social situations with confidence, explaining your dietary choice as a health optimization strategy rather than feeling defensive.",

        "answer": "Both coffee and tea contain polyphenols and tannins that can potentially interfere with vitamin B1 (thiamine) absorption and metabolism. Research suggests these compounds can form complexes with thiamine, reducing its bioavailability. A key mechanism is the potential inhibition of thiamine transport and enzymatic processing by phenolic compounds present in these beverages.\n\nSpecific studies have demonstrated that caffeine and polyphenols can create temporary binding interactions that may reduce thiamine uptake in the gastrointestinal tract. While the effect is not absolute, individuals consuming high quantities of coffee or tea, especially on an already low-carbohydrate diet like carnivore, might be at increased risk of marginal thiamine status. The impact appears dose-dependent, with higher consumption volumes potentially presenting greater absorption challenges.",

        "question": "Why am I not losing weight on carnivore?",
        "answer": "Weight loss on a carnivore diet is not guaranteed and depends on multiple metabolic factors beyond diet composition. While high-protein, low-carbohydrate diets can induce weight loss through increased satiety and potential metabolic advantages, total caloric intake remains the primary determinant of weight change. Some individuals may not lose weight due to consuming excess calories from fatty meats, not maintaining a caloric deficit, or having underlying metabolic adaptations that resist weight loss.\n\nResearch suggests that individual metabolic responses vary significantly. Factors like basal metabolic rate, insulin sensitivity, hormonal status, and genetic predispositions influence weight loss effectiveness. The carnivore diet's high protein and fat content may initially suppress appetite, but long-term adherence and precise caloric control are critical for sustained weight reduction. Additionally, the diet's restrictive nature might lead to potential nutrient deficiencies and metabolic challenges that could impede weight loss progress.",

We’re not big on social media, but being part of your community has been amazing. Being a part of your little family made us believe it’s actually possible to be healthy, and that it’s attainable. I can’t tell you how humbling that is and how much better it’s made our lives, much more so than just what concerns nutrition. Our relationship is even better, to be honest with you! Thanks for showing us that old dogs CAN learn new tricks. Hats off to you, love from ATX and see you all soon.",

Don't buy what you KNOW you're not supposed to be eating, thinking that you're going to be able to regulate and have \"only a little bit\", it's NEVER going to work!! Just don't buy that junk, and trust me, you're not going to die, and soon you'll realize how easy it is to stick to your diet once a week or two pass without putting those things in your body. I've been very strict for 2 weeks and I'm already free and don't feel that I'm missing out on anything, like I used to in the past. Try it. It works!!!",

You wouldn’t put a dog through it. Literally harrowing. I will use it as a reminder for me to stick to my carnivore, fasting and exercise lifestyle I’ve been struggling and trying for the last year. Maybe seeing her go through that is what I needed for even me to ‘get it’ even more than I thought I did. \nI tried to explain to her months ago , she tried the iver once, she also fasted for 16 hours regularly but it’s too hard to believe that ALL health and food is a LIE for some people.

But this video was great.  It's some of the similar stuff from Dr. Boz.  I was so disciplined for a while not eating after 6 or 7 but then it got out of hand, and the holidays have wreaked havoc.  But part of the problem is my inability to eat a full meal.  I get full so easily, and then at 8 I feel so hungry, even if I just ate meat because I can't eat a lot of it. If I could eat more, I would be fine.  I also have a job that oftentimes puts me in a situation where I can't eat regularly, not every day.  And eating a big breakfast, again, the bypass really prevents me from doing so.  I wish even just one person would address the gastric bypass issue.  When mine was done, they did something that actually made it so that it is hard to eat a lot, but especially meat.  If I could have that removed, I would, but I don't even know what it is called, but there is a name for it.  I had my bypass in 1999, if anyone out there knows what I am talking about.

This really is not complicated. If you love bacon, add more bacon. If you want more fat, add more fat. This does not need to be measured to the milligram. That said, after making these hundreds of times, this is the best combination we’ve found.\n\nWe use about 70 percent ground beef and 30 percent ground pork. That combo gives the best flavor and texture. For the beef, we use 10 percent fat. If you go 30 percent fat, it’s just too much. You end up with a ton of liquid in the pan, and the meatballs don’t brown properly.\n\nNext, we add one egg. That’s it. No fillers. No breadcrumbs. No nonsense. We mix everything together by hand in a bowl.\n\nWhen it comes to size, this part matters. The sweet spot is right around a golf ball size. If they’re bigger than that, they don’t cook evenly and you miss out on the Maillard reaction, which is where the flavor comes from.\n\nNow toppings. This is optional, but if you’re doing them, cheese works great. Our favorite combo by far is bacon with blue cheese crumble.\n\nHere’s the key with bacon: cut it up ahead of time and cook it about 80 percent of the way in the air fryer. You don’t want it crispy yet, because you’re going to mix it into the raw meat and cook it again. If it’s fully cooked first, it just burns.\n\nOnce the meatballs are formed, the easiest and most consistent method is on a cookie sheet in the oven. You’ll want to flip them halfway through, and depending on the fat content, you may need to drain a little fat.\n\nOven method:\n\nTemperature: 400°F\nTime: 18 to 22 minutes total\nFlip at about 10 to 12 minutes\n\nThe secondary method, if you want more crust, is cast iron. Brown the meatballs on the stovetop with a little tallow, then transfer the whole pan to the oven and finish them there.\nThat’s it. Simple. Flexible. No overthinking. Make them your own.\n#carnivore #cheapmeals #keto \n🙏 Welcome\nWelcome to HomesteadHow / Healing Humanity!\nHere I share life on my homestead and my journey exploring a proper human diet.

I hatch them out as fox always get them next day.  \n     The hawks and coyotes come to feed when I mow. Then rake then bale then pick up bales. They wait and grab mice and frogs as I go by.  I have videos on my channel of that as well.       The hawks will set on the bales and swoop down as I take other ones to stack on trailer.    The turkeys feast on the insects for months with the shorter grass giving the poults a chance to make fall in our northern climate.",

When it comes to unexplained depression and anxiety, which is quite severe, it's not something talk therapy can fix, it's a hormone inbalance. But, we're not told this, as in diet could be the source, we are prescribed pills, with all their complications to manage eating a poor diet, that is the problem. It's inflamation, poison, from my experience of severe anxiety and depression. I would really like to hear you explain these benefits of eating a proper human diet, and how it can potentially heal, give relief from anxiety and depression.",

How can anyone know whether reducing these meds and going on a carnivore diet would be a better way to go when these doctors only put fear into our minds if we do otherwise?

You should be very proud of yourself!!\nSometimes I dont feel like I look much different, even after losing 35 pounds.  I know my clothes fit better, but I still feel the same Sometimes when I look in the mirror (even though its just in my head). I went to our local farmers market this morning and there was a lady there that I hadn't seen since before I started Carnivore... she took one look at me and asked me how much weight I have lost because she said I look like my weight just melted away. I am doing this way of life for the health benefits I am feeling, not for just weight loss, but sometimes it feels nice to have someone notice the effort I am putting in.\nI'm guessing the same goes for you. Yea, the weight loss is great, but also just the feeling healthier and having the better mental health I have heard you talk about makes much more impact on ur life. \nUr a Rockstar!",

I easily kept the weight off and started truly working out consistently and even began challenging myself... who AM I, I thought?! \nAlmost 3 yrs ago, I unexpectedly lost my Mom... and the very first food I craved was a doughnut. My husband was shocked, but wanted to do ANYTHING to support me on that day and so he went and bought them for me. And I never stopped eating carbs. During the past 3 yrs, I've learned that I'm truly an emotional eater, something I've sworn my whole life that I was not. I honestly believed my hunger shut down during stressful times.... I couldn't have been more wrong.\nThis past year has been BY FAR a never-ending carb buffet and I've put on a lot of weight... I'd guess half of that weight that I'd lost. I do not use a scale.  I've grown out of my clothes and the nasty horrible voices are screaming in my head, every single day at what a failure I still am. Working out had def gone by the wayside except for a few attempts at getting back at it, to the point that I canceled my gym membership.\nI've finally reached that point again where I just can't deal with my body and my mind anymore. I want it all back, the small sizes (yes, I'm vain, but honest), feeling amazing in my body, and feeling so very proud of myself for leaving that body behind and having the life I've always wanted. I've also accepted the facts that I actually am a highly emotional eater AND carbs are an addiction for me. I have made peace with those FACTS and said my goodbyes to carbs. This was the silver-lining that came from being completely out of control, especially this past year. I've grieved over these realizations, and continue to do so, but I think it's part of the healing process. I didn't know these things about myself, and now I do. I must live a  true carnivore lifestyle, notjing sweet tasting at all, just like an alcoholic has  to 100% abstain to remain sober and well.\nI've successfully eaten carnivore for the past 2 days and I renewed my gym membership. It's time. I want this for myself. And I know how it feels when I've cut the bs and have made a commitment.  I've done it... all the way.... and I know I'll be there again by next Christmas or before. \nPs... I just turned 60 y/o and I don't feel like it (or act like it, lol). Many of my physical pains never returned. I'm pulling out all the stops to get myself back to where  I was and live to at least 90! Not hoping or wishing..... DOING!\nTHANKS to all who've read to the end. I hope this helps at least one person. ❤",

In may 2024 I joined SBG and startet priming. That took a looong time of eating a lot and all the time. But my body started to heal and my hormones got in better and better balance. Still working on that. But one day I eat a late breakfast and early dinner therefore got to 2mad. For a month it was just once maybe twice a week. Most days a got a headache if I only ate two times. Now I have been eating 2mad for 14 days and it is working so well. Planing on eating 3mad over Christmas to make sure I stay carnivore. One and a half month ago I started to walk more. I had really worked on that but it was hard. We bought a small treadmill and now things are moving. I walk more also outside than before we got it. This had finally made my body change. I'm loosing fat and gaining muscle. I'm impressed with what walking can help with. I had know idea!\nJust wanted to share and wish everyone a marry Christmas ❤",

It was tremendously successful at first, but i lost steam after about 6 months, so I went in harder. Less and less carbs, more and more strict until I eventually was carnivore. With keto, my a1c dropped into normal ranges without meds, but after 5 years of keto and two years of carnivore-ish, my glucose climbed and climbed until my a1c went back into pre-diabetic range. I reintroduced a balanced diet with more modest carbs (100g per day) and my a1c dropped back into normal range and I lost a few more pounds. I can attest, at least anecdotally, that going carnivore did increase my a1c and fasting glucose both. \n\nSo thank you for this one!",

We’ve switch to 93/7 because we lost so much fat in the air fryer and when we poured it over our patties, so we could consume more of the fat, it went right through my husband and he’d have diarrhea. \nMy favorite way to eat it is (for breakfast) 4 oz browned then I add two scrambled eggs and cook till done. Salted! (Redmonds) I also add a dollop of my homemade L Reuteri yogurt. It is very satisfying and holds me over till we eat an early supper.",

          "description": "This Should NOT Be in Food\nWhy are some ingredients banned in other countries—but still showing up in everyday U.S. groceries? In today’s video, I’m breaking down 10 foods (and food practices) that are restricted or banned abroad, yet have historically been allowed here. #FoodSafety #NutritionTruth\n\nWe’ll talk about additives like titanium dioxide, bromated flour (potassium bromate), azodicarbonamide, propylparaben, and more—plus the bigger picture: the difference between precautionary regulation vs “prove harm first” policies. #MetabolicHealth #RootCause #HealthEducation\n\nThis matters because our health isn’t just shaped by calories—it’s shaped by exposures, hormone disruption, inflammation, and the quiet ingredients that slip into ultra-processed foods. If you’re working on insulin resistance, weight loss, fatigue, gut issues, or overall wellness, your label-reading habits matter more than you think. #InsulinResistance #WeightLoss #Inflammation #GutHealth\n\nIn this video, you’ll learn:\n\nWhich additives are commonly found in U.S. processed foods\n\nWhy some countries restrict or ban them\n\nWhat to look for on labels (so you’re not eating “chemistry class” by accident)\n\nSimple ways to reduce your exposure without living on lettuce and tears #RealFood #UltraProcessedFoods\n\n👉 Drop a comment: Which ingredient shocked you the most—and what product have you seen it in?\n✅ If you want a follow-up, I can do a “grocery swap list” with cleaner alternatives you can actually find and afford. #HealthySwaps\n\nFor more metabolic health content—low-carb, keto, carnivore-friendly strategies, and root-cause medicine—check the playlist and the description. #Keto #LowCarb #Carnivore #ProtectYourNEST",

Partially hydrogenated.\nWhen you see this in products, animal or plant STAY AWAY.  (I believe fully hydrogenated lard is o.k. because it ensures it remains a stable saturated fat)\n\n2. Modified starch of any kind.\n\n3. Maltodextrin (which the liver processes like alcohol, because frankly it is)\n\nI'd elaborate but this is already a TLDR and the last I will cheat and allow sometimes when I know it's a sparse amount Ill only use occasionally. \nThat's all from me for now, and again great video.",

In this year-end “wish I knew” guide, I walk you through the Top 12 things beginners need to expect—and exactly what to do to fix them—so you can stay consistent long enough to see real healing and real results. #metabolichealth #guthealth\n\nIn this video, you’ll learn:\n✅ Why “keto flu” is often an #electrolytes problem (not your body “rejecting meat”) #keto\n✅ The simple salt strategy most beginners miss (and when to actually use electrolyte drinks) #salt\n✅ How to fix #constipation on carnivore without panic or gimmicks\n✅ Why early #diarrhea happens (fat timing + bile adaptation) and how to calm it down fast\n✅ What to do if you get a #rash (and when it’s time to get checked)\n✅ Why #sleep can get weird before it gets better—and the fixes that work\n✅ The craving protocol that helps you beat #sugar cravings without “willpower Olympics”\n✅ When #dairy helps… and when it secretly stalls your progress\n✅ What “nutrient deficiency” signs to watch for (and why you shouldn’t shotgun supplements) #supplements\n✅ The baseline labs I’d consider before a serious nutrition change—and what to recheck later #labs\n✅ The medication warning every beginner needs if they’re on diabetes or blood pressure meds #diabetes #bloodpressure\n✅ A realistic timeline for the first 30–90 days so you don’t quit during the transition window #weightloss\n\nThis is not medical advice—this is education. If you’re on insulin, sulfonylureas, or multiple blood pressure meds (especially diuretics), work with your clinician and monitor closely. #health\n\n🔥 Your 2026 challenge: Run this as a 30-day experiment. Track sleep, cravings, digestion, energy, mood, inflammation, and body measurements—because the scale is only one instrument in the orchestra. #fatloss #wellness\n\n👇 Comment below: Where are you watching from, and what do you want carnivore to help you with in 2026—fat loss, gut healing, autoimmune symptoms, energy, cravings, mood, or something else? #newyear #transformation",

Fix the variables. 🥩🔥",

But, as someone trained as a mental health therapist, what carnivore advocates need to start addressing is the HUGE psychological push to eat in order to modify mood. What will need to be done, and I find this with my weekly fasting for 36 hours, which may likely fall by the wayside during this carnivore cruise, is to reinforce the notion that all the extra time one gets from going carnivore can be spent constructively, can improve your life tremendously, can open up your horizons to all new kinds of adventures. It is not food's responsibility to fill the voids in one's life - it is ours. Some people, probably like you, Dr. Tony, already have plenty of interests that fill up their lives and time. Some people already hate vegetables, and that helps them. Some people just don't care that much about eating - talk about a cake walk, pun intended! But the rest of us are going to have to overcome hurdles as we work heartily to make our health the best it can be, to stop being sick all too often. Thank you in advance, all you awesome carnivore advocates out there, for helping the rest of us with figuring out how to stop self-medicating with food! Getting rid of symptoms is a most amazing outcome, but we need to know how to make that type of important outcome worth the training it will take to give up claiming happiness the easy way - by picking up a cupcake, a cookie, a piece of pie, etc. - rather than putting ourselves first for the LONG RUN. Because that's what we're here for - and we want that long run to be better and better every day, as carnivores describe day in and day out on these precious channels. So best wishes, everyone - we are here to support each other, and massive thanks to all, including Dr. Tony, who take the time to do that! <3 Happy new 2026, everyone. 🙂",

I wasn't hungry until the evening, and barely even then! This morning, I'm having a ribeye with, even as you mentioned it above, two eggs. It's so weird not to be making excuses about having sweets and treats during this major holiday, but videos like yours help make it possible. You're a great encourager, and I wish you and yours the very best during this holiday season and a wonderful New Year! 🙂",
