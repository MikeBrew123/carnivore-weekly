  "weekly_summary": "# Carnivore Diet YouTube Analysis - Week in Review\n\n**Analysis Date:** January 1, 2026\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nWell, this is... interesting. As a carnivore diet expert, I have to be honest with you: **the top-performing \"carnivore diet\" search result this week is literally about refried beans** from a channel called \"The Plant Slant.\" \n\nThe irony is not lost on me. 🥩➡️🫘\n\n---\n\n## Key Observations\n\n### 1. **Algorithm Mismatch**\nThe search query \"carnivore diet\" returned content that's the *opposite* of carnivore eating. This tells us:\n- **Competition for carnivore keywords may be low** right now\n- Plant-based creators are potentially ranking for meat-related searches\n- There's a content gap to exploit\n\n### 2. **What's Actually Working (Even If Off-Topic)**\nThe Plant Slant's video pulled **367K views** with:\n- Short-form content (likely a YouTube Short)\n- Humor/relatable tone\n- Strong engagement (27K likes, 7.3% like-to-view ratio)\n\n---\n\n## Actionable Insights for Carnivore Creators\n\n| Opportunity | Action |\n|-------------|--------|\n| **Content Gap** | Create consistent carnivore content to dominate this search term |\n| **Short-Form Works** | Quick meal prep Shorts could compete directly |\n| **Humor Sells** | Don't be afraid to add personality—\"suspect-looking\" ribeyes, anyone? |\n| **Post Timing** | This video dropped New Year's Day morning—capitalize on resolution season |\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe carnivore niche appears **underserved** this week. Time to fill that void with quality meat content. 🥩",

  "key_insights": "# Marcus's Analysis: Carnivore Diet YouTube Trends\n\n*Alright, let's dig into this data...*\n\n## The Hard Truth\n\n**Zero carnivore-specific videos found in the past 7 days** from this search. What we're seeing instead is a plant-based channel (\"The Plant Slant\") dominating the search results with 1.2M+ views.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### 1. **The Opposition is Winning the Algorithm**\nThe top result for \"carnivore diet\" is literally a channel called \"The Plant Slant\" posting about refried beans. This tells me:\n- Carnivore content creators are **leaving gaps** in consistent posting\n- Plant-based creators are strategically tagging/optimizing for carnivore keywords\n\n### 2. **Engagement Numbers to Beat**\n- 367K views on a short-form bean video\n- 27K likes (7.3% like ratio - solid)\n- 632 comments\n\n**Actionable takeaway:** Carnivore creators need to match this posting frequency and engagement bait.\n\n### 3. **Content Opportunity**\n\nThe comment section is pure humor/entertainment - zero nutrition debate. This means:\n\n> **There's a vacuum for authoritative carnivore content right now.**\n\n## What Carnivore Creators Should Do\n\n1. **Post daily short-form content** - steak prep, meal reveals, \"what I eat in a day\"\n2. **Use contrast hooks** - \"Why I'll never eat those beans again\"\n3. **Respond to plant-based content directly** - the algorithm loves conflict\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe carnivore community is being out-hustled on YouTube this week. Time to fire up the grill AND the camera.\n\n*-Marcus*",
