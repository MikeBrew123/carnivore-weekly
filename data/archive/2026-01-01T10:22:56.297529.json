  "weekly_summary": "# Carnivore Diet YouTube Analysis Summary\n\n**As Sarah, Carnivore Diet Expert**\n\n## Key Observation\n\nThis data reveals something important: **The top-performing \"carnivore diet\" search result isn't carnivore content at all** — it's a plant-based channel called \"The Plant Slant\" featuring refried beans.\n\n## What This Tells Us\n\n1. **Content Gap Exists**: With 0 total carnivore-specific videos found in the past 7 days ranking highly, there's a visibility problem for actual carnivore creators.\n\n2. **Algorithm Mismatch**: YouTube is surfacing plant-based content for carnivore searches, likely due to keyword overlap or engagement metrics.\n\n## Actionable Insights for Carnivore Creators\n\n**Immediate Opportunities:**\n\n- **Post consistently** — the space appears underserved this week\n- **Use clear titles** — include \"Carnivore Diet\" explicitly, not just \"meat-based\" or \"zero carb\"\n- **Create response content** — address plant-based claims directly to capture search traffic\n\n**Content Ideas Based on This Gap:**\n\n- \"What I Eat in a Day: Carnivore Edition\" (simple, high-engagement format)\n- Short-form content (the bean video is clearly a YouTube Short with 367K views)\n- New Year's themed carnivore content (timely for the January 1 collection date)\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe carnivore community needs more active, optimized content creators. The audience is searching — they're just not finding us.",

  "key_insights": "# Marcus's Carnivore Diet YouTube Analysis\n\n*Alright, let me break down what we're seeing here...*\n\n## The Brutal Truth\n\n**We have a problem.** The top-performing \"carnivore diet\" search result this week is a channel called \"The Plant Slant\" posting about... **refried beans**. \n\nLet that sink in.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### 1. **The Algorithm is Serving Plant-Based Content to Carnivore Searchers**\n- A video about beans is ranking for \"carnivore diet\" searches\n- 1.2M+ views going to content that's literally the *opposite* of what people searched for\n- This represents a **massive content gap** and opportunity\n\n### 2. **Engagement Metrics Worth Noting**\n| Metric | Value |\n|--------|-------|\n| Views | 367,732 |\n| Likes | 27,013 |\n| Comments | 632 |\n| Like-to-View Ratio | ~7.3% (very strong) |\n\nThe engagement is solid, but it's irrelevant to our community.\n\n## Actionable Insights for Carnivore Creators\n\n1. **FILL THE VOID** - There's clearly a lack of fresh carnivore content this week. If you're not posting consistently, plant-based creators will absorb your audience.\n\n2. **Post New Year's Content NOW** - People are searching \"carnivore diet\" for resolutions. Where are the \"2026 Carnivore Reset\" videos?\n\n3. **Short-Form is Winning** - This appears to be a YouTube Short. Carnivore creators: get your steak sizzles and ribeye ASMR up *today*.\n\n**Bottom line: The carnivore space is being outworked. Time to step up.**",
