  "weekly_summary": "# Carnivore Diet YouTube Analysis Summary\n\n**As Sarah, Carnivore Diet Expert**\n\n## Key Observation\n\nThis data reveals an interesting competitive landscape situation. The top-performing content in the \"carnivore diet\" search space this week is actually from **a plant-based channel** (\"The Plant Slant\") - not a carnivore advocate.\n\n## Actionable Insights\n\n### 1. **Content Gap Opportunity**\n- With 0 dedicated carnivore videos ranking in the top results, there's a clear opportunity for carnivore creators to produce fresh, engaging content\n- The plant-based competition is winning visibility in *our* search terms\n\n### 2. **What's Working (Learn from the Competition)**\n- **Short-form content**: The viral video is a quick, casual cooking clip\n- **Humor and relatability**: Comments show audiences respond to personality and funny moments\n- **Consistency**: Posting even on holidays (New Year's Day) captures attention\n\n### 3. **Specific Action Items for Carnivore Creators**\n\n| Strategy | Example |\n|----------|---------|\n| Create short-form refried *beef* or carnivore meal prep clips | \"Might look suspect, but I love me some beef tallow scrambled eggs\" |\n| Use humor and casual presentation | Don't over-polish; authenticity wins |\n| Post during content gaps | Holiday weekends when competitors are quiet |\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n**The carnivore community is leaving views on the table.** When plant-based content dominates carnivore-related searches, it's a wake-up call to create more consistent, engaging content that actually represents our dietary approach.",
  "trending_topics": "# Carnivore Diet Trending Analysis\n\n**Analysis Date:** January 1, 2026 | **Data Period:** Past 7 days\n\n---\n\n## 🚨 Key Finding\n\n**No carnivore-specific content surfaced in the top results this week.** The algorithm returned a plant-based creator (\"The Plant Slant\") for the \"carnivore diet\" search query, which tells us something important.\n\n---\n\n## Actionable Insights\n\n### 1. **Content Gap = Opportunity**\nThe carnivore space appears quiet during the holiday week (Dec 25 - Jan 1). This is prime time to post while competition is low.\n\n**Action:** Create content NOW about:\n- \"New Year carnivore reset\"\n- \"How I stayed carnivore through the holidays\"\n- \"January carnivore challenge kickoff\"\n\n### 2. **Short-Form is Dominating**\nThe top-performing video is a quick, casual cooking clip with:\n- 367K views\n- 27K likes (7.3% like ratio - very high)\n- Minimal description, no tags\n\n**Action:** Carnivore creators should post simple, quick meal prep shorts. Think: \"searing a ribeye\" or \"egg yolks in a bowl\" with personality.\n\n### 3. **Humor Wins Engagement**\nTop comments are all jokes and casual banter, not nutritional debate.\n\n**Action:** Lean into relatable carnivore humor rather than defensive nutrition arguments. Example: \"My grocery receipt is just 4 lines\" or steak ASMR content.\n\n---\n\n## Bottom Line\n\n**Post this week.** The carnivore niche is underserving the New Year's resolution crowd right now.",
  "key_insights": "# Analysis: Carnivore Diet YouTube Landscape (Past 7 Days)\n\n*Marcus here, let me break down what this data is actually telling us.*\n\n## The Brutal Truth\n\n**Zero carnivore diet videos found in the top results.** The algorithm served up a vegan/plant-based channel (\"The Plant Slant\") as the top creator for a \"carnivore diet\" search. That's... ironic.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### 1. **The Opposition Is Dominating Search**\nThe Plant Slant pulled **1.2M+ views** this week on content that's antithetical to carnivore. This tells me:\n- Plant-based creators are either better at SEO\n- They're actively targeting carnivore-related keywords\n- There's a content gap carnivore creators aren't filling\n\n### 2. **Short-Form Is Winning**\nThe top video is a quick refried beans clip with:\n- **367K views**\n- **27K likes** (7.3% engagement rate - that's strong)\n- Minimal description, no tags, pure entertainment\n\n**Actionable takeaway:** Carnivore creators need more Shorts/quick hits, not just 45-minute podcasts.\n\n### 3. **Humor Drives Engagement**\nLook at those top comments - they're all joking about the visual/sound of the food. The content isn't educational, it's *entertaining*.\n\n## What Carnivore Creators Should Do\n\n1. **Create reaction content** to plant-based videos (algorithm loves conflict)\n2. **Post more Shorts** showing ribeyes sizzling, simple meal preps\n3. **Use humor** - the \"suspect looking\" meat joke writes itself\n4. **Optimize for \"carnivore diet\" keywords** since competitors clearly are\n\nThe niche is underserved. That's opportunity.",
